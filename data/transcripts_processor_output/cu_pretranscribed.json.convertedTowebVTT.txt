00:00.080 --> 00:02.240
<v Agent>Hi there, thank you for calling Contoso.

00:02.240 --> 00:03.200
<v Agent>My name is Sam.

00:03.440 --> 00:04.720
<v Agent>How can I help you today?

00:05.520 --> 00:07.680
<v Customer>Good afternoon, my name is Mary Adams.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.720
<v Customer>I want to buy life insurance for my husband.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.520
<v Customer>Can you please tell me how much it costs?

00:14.400 --> 00:17.200
<v Agent>I'm going to help you right now with your life insurance needs.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.760
<v Agent>Are you the owner of the policy?

00:20.560 --> 00:28.960
<v Customer>My husband and I are the owners of the policy, so I will be paying for the policy myself, but I want him to be protected in case something happens to me.

00:29.840 --> 00:30.120
<v Agent>Good.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.320
<v Agent>What type of policy are you looking for?

00:33.200 --> 00:36.720
<v Agent>We have term life, whole life, universal life, etc.

00:37.520 --> 00:44.560
<v Customer>Term would be perfect for us, but can you please tell me how much the monthly payment would be for term life with $500,000 of coverage?

00:45.360 --> 00:53.440
<v Agent>If you pay $30 each month, your husband will be insured for a total of $500,000 of coverage with a monthly premium of $30.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.320
<v Customer>How often would we have to pay this premium?

00:57.200 --> 01:04.240
<v Agent>You will pay this premium every month until you reach age 100 or your husband dies, whichever happens first.

01:05.040 --> 01:10.000
<v Agent>Would you like to schedule a payment date so that your husband can start receiving his insurance coverage?

01:10.880 --> 01:11.280
<v Customer>Yes.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.720
<v Customer>How soon can you schedule it?

01:13.520 --> 01:16.640
<v Agent>Let me see if there are any open dates for today or tomorrow.

01:17.520 --> 01:18.560
<v Agent>Would that work for you?

01:19.440 --> 01:20.640
<v Customer>That is fine with me.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.160
<v Agent>OK, Mrs.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.000
<v Agent>Adams, I have an opening tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.720
<v Agent>Would either of those times work for you?

01:29.600 --> 01:31.040
<v Customer>Yes, I can do 10 a.m.

01:31.040 --> 01:31.920
<v Customer>tomorrow morning.

01:32.720 --> 01:33.200
<v Agent>Great.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.960
<v Agent>I will call you tomorrow morning at 9:45 a.m.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.840
<v Agent>with payment instructions and confirmation information.

01:40.640 --> 01:41.520
<v Agent>Is that okay?

01:42.400 --> 01:43.520
<v Customer>That sounds great.

01:44.320 --> 01:47.200
<v Customer>I'll talk to you tomorrow morning at 9:45 a.m.```
