00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Hi there, thank you for calling Contoso. My name is Sam.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:01.200
<v Speaker 2>How can I help you today?

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Good afternoon. My name is Mary Adams.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to buy life insurance for my husband.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Can you please tell me how much it costs?

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:02.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to help you right now with your life insurance needs.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Are you the owner of the policy? My husband and I are the owners of the policy,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>so I will be paying for the policy myself, but I want him to be protected in case something happens to me.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Good. What type of policy are you looking?

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:00.360
<v Speaker 1>For

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:00.160
<v Speaker 1>we.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Have term life, whole life, universal life, etc.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Term would be perfect for us, but can you please tell me how much the monthly payment would be for term life with $500,000 of coverage?

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:07.840
<v Speaker 2>If you pay $30 each month, your husband will be insured for a total of $500,000 of coverage, with a monthly premium of $30.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:01.800
<v Speaker 1>How often would we have to pay this premium?

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:04.600
<v Speaker 2>You will pay this premium every month until you reach age 100 or your husband dies.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:00:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Whichever happens first.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Would you like to schedule a payment date so that your husband can start receiving his insurance coverage?

00:01:10.950 --> 00:00:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Yes. How soon can you schedule it?

00:01:13.670 --> 00:00:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Let me.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:00:00.640
<v Speaker 2>See if there are.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:00:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Any open dates for today or?

00:01:16.150 --> 00:00:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Tomorrow.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:00:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Would that work for?

00:01:18.310 --> 00:00:00.320
<v Speaker 2>You.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:00:01.080
<v Speaker 1>That is fine with me.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:00:00.320
<v Speaker 2>OK.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:00:00.120

00:01:22.030 --> 00:00:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Adams, I have an opening tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM.
