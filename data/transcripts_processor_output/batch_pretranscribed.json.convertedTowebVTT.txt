<v Speaker 1>Hi there, thank you for calling Contoso.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.200
<v Speaker 1>My name is Sam.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.720
<v Speaker 1>How can I help you today?

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Good afternoon, my name is Mary Adams.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.720
<v Speaker 2>I want to buy life insurance for my husband.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Can you please tell me how much it costs?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to help you right now with your life insurance needs.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Are you the owner of the policy?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 2>My husband and I are the owners of the policy, so I will be paying for the policy myself, but I want him to be protected in case something happens to me.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Good.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>What type of policy are you looking for?

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>We have term life, whole life, universal life, etc.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Term would be perfect for us, but can you please tell me how much the monthly payment would be for term life with $500,000 of coverage?

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>If you pay $30 each month, your husband will be insured for a total of $500,000 of coverage with a monthly premium of $30.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 2>How often would we have to pay this premium?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>You will pay this premium every month until you reach age 100 or your husband dies, whichever happens first.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Would you like to schedule a payment date so that your husband can start receiving his insurance coverage?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 2>How soon can you schedule it?

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Let me see if there are any open dates for today or tomorrow.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Would that work for you?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 2>That is fine with me.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.160
<v Speaker 1>OK, Mrs.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Adams, I have an opening tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Would either of those times work for you?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes, I can do 10 a.m.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow morning.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Great.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I will call you tomorrow morning at 9:45 a.m.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>with payment instructions and confirmation information.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.520
<v Speaker 2>That sounds great.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to you tomorrow morning at 9:45 a.m.
