    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **Pro mode** in Azure AI Content Understanding to enhance your analyzer with multiple inputs and optional reference data. Pro mode is designed for advanced use cases, particularly those requiring multi-step reasoning and complex decision-making (for example, identifying inconsistencies, drawing inferences, and making sophisticated decisions). Pro mode allows input from multiple content files and includes the option to provide reference data at analyzer creation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "1. Create an analyzer with a schema and reference data.\n",
    "2. Analyze your files using Pro mode.\n",

    "    - Alternatively, set both `REFERENCE_DOC_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` and `REFERENCE_DOC_CONTAINER_NAME` so that the SAS URL can be generated automatically during a later step.\n",
