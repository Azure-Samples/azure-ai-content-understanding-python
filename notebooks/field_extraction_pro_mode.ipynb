    "This notebook demonstrates how to use **Pro mode** in Azure AI Content Understanding to enhance your analyzer with multiple inputs and optional reference data. Pro mode is designed for advanced use cases, particularly those requiring multi-step reasoning and complex decision-making (for example, identifying inconsistencies, drawing inferences, and making sophisticated decisions). Pro mode allows input from multiple content files and includes the option to provide reference data at analyzer creation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "1. Create an analyzer with a schema and reference data.\n",
    "2. Analyze your files using Pro mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on Pro mode, see the [Azure AI Content Understanding: Standard and Pro Modes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/concepts/standard-pro-modes) documentation."

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "1. Ensure the Azure AI service is configured by following the [setup steps](../README.md#configure-azure-ai-service-resource).\n",
    "2. If using reference documents, please follow [Set env for reference doc](../docs/set_env_for_training_data_and_reference_doc.md) to configure reference document environment variables in the [.env](./.env) file.\n",
    "    - You can set `REFERENCE_DOC_SAS_URL` directly with the SAS URL for your Azure Blob container.\n",
    "    - Alternatively, set both `REFERENCE_DOC_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` and `REFERENCE_DOC_CONTAINER_NAME` so that the SAS URL can be generated automatically during a later step.\n",
    "    - Also, set `REFERENCE_DOC_PATH` to specify the folder path within the container where reference documents will be uploaded.\n",
    "    > ⚠️ Note: Reference documents are optional in Pro mode. You can run Pro mode using only input documents. For example, the service can reason across two or more input files without any reference data.\n",
    "3. Install the required packages to run the sample."
