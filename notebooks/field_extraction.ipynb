    "\n",
    "Before we create our first analyzer, it's important to understand the structure and schema of analyzer templates. Custom analyzers in Azure AI Content Understanding are defined using JSON templates that specify what fields to extract and how to process the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Schema Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`baseAnalyzerId`**: This is crucial as it specifies which prebuilt analyzer to derive from (e.g., `prebuilt-documentAnalyzer`, `prebuilt-audioAnalyzer`, `prebuilt-videoAnalyzer`, `prebuilt-imageAnalyzer`, `prebuilt-callCenter`). This provides the foundation capabilities for your custom analyzer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`fields`**: Define the specific data points you want to extract. Each field has:\n",
    "  - **Field name**: The identifier for the extracted data (required and important for referencing results)\n",
    "  - **Description**: Optional but helpful for documentation and understanding the field's purpose\n",
    "  - **Method**: Can be `\"extract\"` (for extracting existing information from documents - currently only available for document analysis) or `\"generate\"` (for generating new insights using AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`method`**: The overall extraction approach - use `\"extract\"` for standard field extraction from documents or `\"generate\"` when you need AI to generate insights or summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: The `\"extract\"` method is currently only available for document analysis (using `prebuilt-documentAnalyzer`). For other modalities like audio, video, and images, use the `\"generate\"` method.\n",

    "Content Understanding offers three ways to slice a video, letting you get the output you need for whole videos or short clips. You can use these options by setting the `segmentationMode` property on a custom analyzer.\n",
    "- Whole-video – `\"segmentationMode\": \"noSegmentation\"` The service treats the entire video file as a single segment and extracts metadata across its full duration.  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "    - Compliance checks that look for specific brand-safety issues anywhere in an ad\n",
    "    - full-length descriptive summaries\n",
    "- Automatic segmentation – `\"segmentationMode\": \"auto\"` The service analyzes the timeline and breaks it up for you. Groups successive shots into coherent scenes, capped at one minute each.  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "    - Create storyboards from a show\n",
    "    - Inserting mid-roll ads at logical pauses.\n",
    "- Custom segmentation – `\"segmentationMode\": \"custom\"` You describe the logic in natural language and the model creates segments to match. Set `segmentationDefinition` with a string describing how you'd like the video to be segmented. Custom allows segments of varying length from seconds to minutes depending on the prompt.  \n",
