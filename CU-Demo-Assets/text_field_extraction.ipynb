So, in determining where the first response metrics should be taken it made me curious if both events will always be sent and in the same order (speech started, then on recognizing) or not.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2013\\r\\n\\r\\nJosh Schraivogel\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom: Heiko Rahmel <Heiko.Rahmel@microsoft.com <mailto:Heiko.Rahmel@microsoft.com> >\\r\\nDate: Friday, April 11, 2025 at 1:40\\u202fPM\\r\\nTo: Josh Schraivogel <Josh.Schraivogel@genesys.com <mailto:Josh.Schraivogel@genesys.com> >\\r\\nSubject: RE: Microsoft ASR event speechStartDetected\\r\\n\\r\\n EXTERNAL EMAIL - Please use caution with links and attachments \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n________________________________\\r\\n\\r\\nHi Josh,\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nI am checking with our team.
