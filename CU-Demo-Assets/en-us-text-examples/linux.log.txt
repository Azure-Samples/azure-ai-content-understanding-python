Jul 04 13:39:38 *	Topic for #linux set by Khaytsus!~khaytsus@fedora/khaytsus (Wed Jun 21 14:50:49 2023)
Jul 04 13:40:08 *	Guest (~Guest@178.220.58.72) has joined
Jul 04 13:40:38 *	Guest8725 has quit (Client Quit)
Jul 04 13:40:39 *	Umbire has quit (Quit: Umbire zaps a wand of digging!)
Jul 04 13:41:12 <iamlockedout>	First, it goes: "Finished systemd-cryptsetup@disk_four.service - Cryptography Setup for disk_four." "Reached target blockdev@dev-mapper-disk_four.target - Block Device Preparation for /dev/mapper/disk_four...", then the same exact thing but with "disk_three", and then finally "Please enter passphrase for disk SK_hynix_blablabla (disk_two)::" (yes,
Jul 04 13:41:12 <iamlockedout>	that's two colons). And at that point, it just keeps asking, over and over again, no matter what you enter.
Jul 04 13:41:27 <iamlockedout>	A very important thing to mention here is that SK_hynix is the SYSTEM disk... not the second disk.
Jul 04 13:41:48 *	Billy has quit (Server closed connection)
Jul 04 13:41:57 *	Simikando has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jul 04 13:42:02 *	shiraf has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
Jul 04 13:42:15 <iamlockedout>	The second disk is a Samsung. Only the system disk is a SK_hynix.
Jul 04 13:42:22 *	Simikando (~Simi@adsl-dyn-215.95-102-74.t-com.sk) has joined
Jul 04 13:42:22 *	shiraf1 (~shiraf1@94.25.191.114) has joined
Jul 04 13:42:25 <iamlockedout>	So this is very confusing.
Jul 04 13:42:32 *	Billy (~ripdisk@47.145.181.101) has joined
Jul 04 13:42:36 *	Guest has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jul 04 13:42:45 <iamlockedout>	And again, I swear that it booted without doing this nonsense yesterday, after I had set up crypttab but before I had touched fstab.
Jul 04 13:42:48 *	mattallmill (~mattallmi@ip68-103-153-63.ks.ok.cox.net) has joined
Jul 04 13:43:03 <shiraf1>	what it is? https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/android
Jul 04 13:43:09 *	Candlestick has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
Jul 04 13:43:11 *	agvantibo has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
Jul 04 13:43:17 <djph>	well, crypttab and fstab do two completely different things, iamlockedout
Jul 04 13:43:24 <iamlockedout>	djph: Yes, I realize this.
Jul 04 13:43:27 <djph>	iamlockedout: so comment out everything un-necessary in fstab
Jul 04 13:43:28 *	ZindaN has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Jul 04 13:43:35 <iamlockedout>	djph: That is what I did.
Jul 04 13:43:49 <iamlockedout>	But my point is that it didn't have a difference, which is what's so confusing.
Jul 04 13:43:49 <djph>	and it's still complaining ?
Jul 04 13:43:56 *	chromoblob (~user@37.113.180.121) has left

Jul 04 13:44:23 *	Buggys has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
Jul 04 13:44:42 <djph>	guess "also comment out the new stuff from crypttab" is your next step.
Jul 04 13:45:13 *	JanC (~janc@user/janc) has joined
Jul 04 13:45:13 <hexnewbie>	It asking for passphrases in perpetuity implies it's not in fstab, since fstab doesn't result in passphrase prompts (and the only things in there supporting such auth would be network filesystems, like CIFS)
Jul 04 13:45:19 <iamlockedout>	Yes, but now I have lost the commands to get back into the system disk, since I was unable to save the text file on this live USB stick before rebooting...
Jul 04 13:45:23 *	[]i|ie (uid263351@id-263351.uxbridge.irccloud.com) has joined
Jul 04 13:45:28 <ursa>	it would be much simpler if we saw the /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab neither file contains secret data (except for uuid if you care about that)
Jul 04 13:45:48 <hexnewbie>	So I imagine commenting things in crypttab would help more
Jul 04 13:45:56 <djph>	crypttab open --type luks /dev/whatever NAMEHERE
Jul 04 13:45:59 *	ironman has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
Jul 04 13:46:00 <hexnewbie>	Or completely break it, depending on what one comments
Jul 04 13:46:01 <ursa>	djph: cryptsetup
Jul 04 13:46:02 <djph>	then since it's luks
Jul 04 13:46:04 *	weeb_ has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
Jul 04 13:46:09 <djph>	ursa: dammit, I need more coffee

Jul 04 13:46:43 <iamlockedout>	sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda3 meow <-- This is all I had written down by hand. I've ran it now again. Have forgotten about the other parts.
Jul 04 13:46:46 *	aimatme has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
Jul 04 13:46:59 <ursa>	activate the lvm groups
Jul 04 13:47:01 <ursa>	then mount
Jul 04 13:47:05 <djph>	sudo vgscan ; sudo vgchange -ay [volume-name-from-vgscan]
Jul 04 13:47:20 <ursa>	^
Jul 04 13:47:41 <hexnewbie>	ursa: Seeing things? Pff. If he had seen *anything* yesterday, maybe it wouldn't be broken now. But I doubt that will result in seeing anything today, either.
Jul 04 13:47:44 *	Simikando has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jul 04 13:48:13 *	weeb_ (~libera@e1.nixmagic.com) has joined
Jul 04 13:48:15 <iamlockedout>	hexnewbie: ?
Jul 04 13:48:18 <ursa>	hexnewbie: if *we* saw the files
Jul 04 13:48:41 <hexnewbie>	Er, ‘If we had seen’, yeah
Jul 04 13:49:03 <djph>	hexnewbie: what, you don't have a crystal ball?
Jul 04 13:49:21 <ursa>	for example order of entries in fstab can matter
Jul 04 13:49:44 <hexnewbie>	I do speculate that either the key file wasn't on the first unlocked disk, *or* crypttab made it to initramfs when the key file is not available (the latter is somewhat dubious, I've not been able systemd to unlock my spinning drives in initramfs even with implicit 'initramfs' option, and also update-initramfs tends to copy the needed files). But speculation is all one can do.
Jul 04 13:50:10 <ursa>	systemd is not running in initramfs
Jul 04 13:50:11 *	agvantibo (~agvantibo@79.165.97.11) has joined
Jul 04 13:50:32 <hexnewbie>	It's not? Hmm. Perhaps that's why decrypt_keyctl works for me
Jul 04 13:50:33 <iamlockedout>	Well, I'm back into the drive now. Let's dig up the the crypttab...
Jul 04 13:50:47 <Foxboron>	ursa: which distro are you using?
Jul 04 13:51:08 <ursa>	Foxboron: more than one, but mainly debian and archlinux
Jul 04 13:51:29 <ursa>	(and I group all the debian derivatives under debian)
Jul 04 13:51:31 <Foxboron>	ursa: mkinitcpio by default doesn't run with systemd in the initramfs. Debian just doesn't support it at all
Jul 04 13:51:57 <ursa>	Foxboron: is that not what I said?

Jul 04 13:53:04 *	OnkelTem has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
Jul 04 13:53:08 <hexnewbie>	Yeah, yeah, my bad. Indeed it doesn't, I knew that when I setup my own crypttab, and some options of it are tailored at that
Jul 04 13:53:12 <djph>	order of entries and/or that one follower for "mount order", as I recall
Jul 04 13:53:31 *	quitman has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
Jul 04 13:53:34 <iamlockedout>	https://pastebin.com/raw/CVM172fs <-- My crypttab. The first line was what Debian's installer created, and the rest is what we figured out in here yesterday or recently.
Jul 04 13:53:36 <ursa>	findmnt --verify will warn about order of entries
Jul 04 13:53:39 *	quitman (~master@217-64-148-153.pool.ovpn.com) has joined
Jul 04 13:53:53 *	multi8 (~dark@2001:1ba8:1210:e700::605) has joined
Jul 04 13:53:58 <iamlockedout>	The "keyscript=/bin/cat" thing was a weird thing suggested by somebody (also found online) which seemed to make it work.
Jul 04 13:54:08 <iamlockedout>	After it had not worked at first for many tries.
Jul 04 13:54:27 <ursa>	you can get rid of the ,keyscript=/bin/cat it's not necessary in initramfs
Jul 04 13:54:36 <sozuba>	Anyway thanks ursa for the warning on rbind run :)

Jul 04 13:54:38 *	Umbire (~UmbireThe@user/umbire) has joined
Jul 04 13:54:47 <ursa>	and I'm not a fan of /dev/sdX in crypttab, because order does change
Jul 04 13:55:12 <iamlockedout>	What was the command to "check the crypttab without rebooting"? Because it kept giving some error until I added ,keyscript=/bin/cat ...
Jul 04 13:55:29 <iamlockedout>	ursa: I know, but therare no UUIDs listed for those drives so I couldn't use them.
Jul 04 13:55:29 <ursa>	there is no command to check crypttab
Jul 04 13:55:39 <ursa>	cryptdisks_start is not meant to be used in booted system
Jul 04 13:55:46 <iamlockedout>	Well, *some* command was used many times yesterday to "check it".
Jul 04 13:55:53 <hexnewbie>	Yeah /dev/sd{c,d} is definitely wrong. I've had /dev/sda mostly stable, but I suspect even that's not guaranteed.
Jul 04 13:55:56 <iamlockedout>	Yeah. cryptdisks_start was it.
Jul 04 13:55:58 *	Umbire has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jul 04 13:56:10 <hexnewbie>	Is /home/a/Documents/nothinghere on the root mountpoint, or is there a separate /home mountpoint?
Jul 04 13:56:14 <ursa>	hexnewbie: the problem is that the disks have no partitions, so no PARTLABEL or LABEL or PARTUUID
Jul 04 13:56:28 <ursa>	and I don't have an external drive on hand today to see if UUID is generated
Jul 04 13:56:32 <iamlockedout>	I assumed that the sda, sdb stuff was based on which SATA port your disks were physically connected to.
Jul 04 13:56:38 <hexnewbie>	TrueCrypt has no UUID or LABEL?
Jul 04 13:56:46 <ursa>	hexnewbie: truecrypt appears as fully random data
Jul 04 13:56:48 *	MootPoot has quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
Jul 04 13:56:59 <ursa>	it intentionally has no recognizable header
Jul 04 13:57:05 *	lemonzest has quit (Quit: WeeChat 3.6)
Jul 04 13:57:06 <hexnewbie>	/dev/disk/by-id ought to still be available
Jul 04 13:57:19 <iamlockedout>	hexnewbie: /home/a/Documents/nothinghere is on the encrypted system disk.
Jul 04 13:57:27 <iamlockedout>	hexnewbie: But it's decrypted first of all anyway?
Jul 04 13:57:31 <ursa>	hexnewbie: maybe by-path
Jul 04 13:57:47 <hexnewbie>	iamlockedout: Disk yes, but is that system disk a single mountpoint mounted at /, or is /home a separate mountpoint?
Jul 04 13:57:48 <iamlockedout>	And if it were on the non-encrypted part of the system disk, it would be useless since it would reveal the password to anyone inspecting it!
Jul 04 13:58:05 <hexnewbie>	by-path is also good-ish, but I had it changed when upgrading kernels
Jul 04 13:58:10 <hexnewbie>	or udev, not sure if kernel or udev
Jul 04 13:58:12 <ursa>	iamlockedout: unlocked (opened, decrypted) and mounted are separate operations
Jul 04 13:58:22 <iamlockedout>	hexnewbie: I used the full disk (one partition) and not a separate partition for /home in the Debian installation if that's what you're asking?
Jul 04 13:58:32 *	tom__ (~tom@178-119-247-4.access.telenet.be) has joined
Jul 04 13:58:59 <ursa>	anyway, I know the problem, I'll explain based on the crypttab I've seen
Jul 04 13:59:01 <hexnewbie>	iamlockedout: Yeah, that's good, so /home/a/Documents/nothinghere will be mounted. Although I am not sure the file will be correctly populated to the initramfs in that case
Jul 04 13:59:22 <iamlockedout>	(And also the "no newline in keyfile" thing was dealt with yesterday.)
Jul 04 13:59:30 <hexnewbie>	Actually I don't know if the failure occurs in initramfs or during latter boot
Jul 04 13:59:34 <ursa>	sdb3_crypt is opened, but not mounted, so /home/a/Documents/nothinghere is not available, so you get asked for a password instead
Jul 04 13:59:37 *	node1 (~bipul@user/node1) has joined
Jul 04 13:59:46 <ursa>	the way people work around it is by including the key into the initramfs
Jul 04 13:59:50 *	cafkafk has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jul 04 13:59:53 <ursa>	but that means you need to have an encrypted /boot
Jul 04 14:00:03 *	romero78 (~romero78@2601:343:4100:70a0:6072:4a85:792c:6cbe) has joined
Jul 04 14:00:15 <iamlockedout>	How can /boot be encrypted if it's what contains the boot loader?
Jul 04 14:00:29 <ursa>	overall I wouldn't bother with crypttab at all, I'd just run a script after logging in to unlock and mount those drives
Jul 04 14:00:44 <ursa>	iamlockedout: you're on UEFI, the "bootloader" is on the ESP
Jul 04 14:00:48 <DocTator>	exit
Jul 04 14:00:51 <ursa>	/boot can be encrypted
Jul 04 14:00:58 *	DocTator has quit (Remote host closed the connection)

Jul 04 14:01:25 <iamlockedout>	I don't have Secure Boot enabled anymore due to the problems it caused.
Jul 04 14:01:30 *	Ariana69 (~ariana69@dragon.ptr.ari.beauty) has joined
Jul 04 14:01:39 <ursa>	secure boot is irrelevant here
Jul 04 14:01:47 *	Stark86 has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
Jul 04 14:02:26 <iamlockedout>	Alright, I will comment the lines in crypttab as well and see if it finally boots back up (now I'm no longer sure about anything), and then deal with trying to make a script instead...
Jul 04 14:02:31 *	sarandom_ has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jul 04 14:02:45 <iamlockedout>	Still don't see why anything about this was weird/nonstandard except for the use of NTFS.

Jul 04 14:06:28 <iamlockedout>	Feels like a defeat to give up on it entirely. It "should be working".

Jul 04 14:07:27 <iamlockedout>	I mean, you gave an explanation before, but since I'm not doing some exotic, weird stuff, I don't see why it's a special case for me.
Jul 04 14:07:35 <djph>	user error, caused by "learning a new thing".  (probably)
Jul 04 14:08:33 <shiraf1>	what it is? https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/android
Jul 04 14:08:44 <djph>	e.g. trying to use a keyfile that's on an as-yet-unavailable partition (which I've done in the past ... hooo that took some thinking)
Jul 04 14:09:05 <ursa>	^
Jul 04 14:09:05 <Gaboradon>	Had a discussion with some tech guys recently, and there was talk what if there were two new dedicated keyboard keys and a change of existing "Return" function.
Jul 04 14:09:11 <djph>	shiraf1: it's a link to the docker hub website.
Jul 04 14:09:30 *	Stark86 (~Thunderbi@2405:201:d01c:d0c:6801:495:dc9d:1fd2) has joined
Jul 04 14:09:42 <iamlockedout>	The "general" thing that is happening here (or SHOULD be happning) is that: 1. The computer boots. 2. It loads the unencrypted Linux bootloader code. 3. This detects that there is an encrypted system drive. 4. It asks for the decryption passphrase. 5. I enter it. 6. It's now decrypted. 7. The crypttab file inside this now decrypted filesystem tells
Jul 04 14:09:42 <iamlockedout>	Linux to also mount the other drives based on the passphrase stored in the first disk. 8. It should just be working. But it's perpetually asking for the same crap and not even giving an error message or information of any kind.
Jul 04 14:09:51 <djph>	Gaboradon: (1) why do we need two more keys, (2) what's wrong with 'enter' / 'return' today?
Jul 04 14:11:00 <iamlockedout>	Also, we have the disturbing part where, unless I was hallucinating yesterday, it *DID* work at least for one boot until I started trying to deal with fstab.
Jul 04 14:11:02 *	dsrt^ (~dsrt@24.125.210.85) has joined
Jul 04 14:11:20 <Gaboradon>	Existing "Space" button would mean only a visual space within a word/path", while "Return" would mean "Confirm", there would be a new key for "New Line" and "Word Separator" ... you would never use the same key to make newline and confirm a command (run script), and you would use the same key to make a space between file paths and a space between command arguments.

Jul 04 14:13:38 <djph>	shiraf1: whatever's included in that docker image, I guess
Jul 04 14:13:51 <Gaboradon>	Let me try this again: Spacebar and Return keys would both split, you'd get two spaces and two return keys, splitting the functions. Critical command line programs would take advantage of this so when writing paths with spaces you would use the old spacebar, while writing separators between commands/parameters/variables you'd use a new separate key

Perhaps not the lack of an additional separator, but the implementation of the "Space" might have been incorrect. However, the implementation and functions of the "Space" button might have been such because there was only one and the original designers had no other idea at the time.

Linux (kernel and all the user space stuff) could easily be patched right this moment to rip out the confirmation function of the Return key and use it for only NewLine and that's it. All you terminal commands would be exectured, prompts confirmed, processes continued, with NumpadEnter key. That really wouldn't take that much to get used to.

Jul 04 14:50:46 <djph>	xiaomiao: not at all.  AIUI though, a "normal" filesystem will generally create a file in continuous sectors from start to finish ...
Jul 04 14:51:00 <djph>	well, assuming there's sufficient free space to do so.

Jul 04 14:51:08 <xiaomiao>	~_~
Jul 04 14:51:20 <Gaboradon>	That would then indeed require intra subheaders and footers on each file chunk, which would admittingly have a noticable size penalty which would be significant in 1969, but there's no way around it, data safety's not cheap I guess.
Jul 04 14:51:21 <djph>	then there's FAT or NTFS where it just crams everything as tightly as possible

Jul 04 15:11:32 <Gaboradon>	djph: Whether CHS addresses are stored on the data platters or the internal secret memory chip in the HDD's controller isn't that important right now because we have SSDs and my idea in general was, well these CHS addresses and SSD's equivalents could be stored in the header of each file. Each time a FS would write a file, the kernel(where FS is implemented) would automatically create a header by default which has important metadata on file and
Jul 04 15:11:32 <djph>	Gaboradon: but rather that there is obviously "something, somewhere" in how the machine handles the user asking to open "/path/to/somefile.ext"  -> retrieving the inode -> getting the file's start address (on the HDD) -> getting any additional sector address(es)
Jul 04 15:11:33 <Gaboradon>	ofcourse the filename, date and times, even things like how many times it was edited, sky is the limit, this would be a great redundancy in additon to the overall FS's index that's stored separately or traditionally all in one big chunk somewhere else.

This per-file (and per-fragment) the most hardcore and would be the most space costly, no diagreement there that it may be overkill. HDDs would benefit more than SSDs in situation of bad sectors usually eappearing around a specific area and if that area has the consolidated FS index block then it can all go out, versus spread-across metadata.

Jul 04 15:38:09 <Gaboradon>	Heh, the command that reminded me of the new "Space" key discussion was the "dd .... of=/dev/sdX status=progress" - I don't know the history and opinions on linux power users, someone said earlier that paths are a pain to work with, but this one space between a destination and another parameter seems a bit too risky or just visually not separated enough.
Jul 04 15:38:48 <rascul>	spaces are hard because of the shell
Jul 04 15:39:15 <rascul>	they're generally no problem using some other language
Jul 04 15:39:39 <Gaboradon>	And I would agree on alternatives, perhaps it's the lack of design standards of the way terminal apps are manipulated and controlled, you have some arguments starting with -- and some have no prefix, some have only one -, etc
Jul 04 15:39:55 <djph>	If your /dev/disk path is a pain to work with because you added spaces ... that's a "you" problem.

Jul 04 17:22:45 <Guest17>	Hi so, my distro doesn't come with snd_seq compiled or as module it seems, which seems to be why several programs aren't recognizing this midi keyboard I have connecting. /dev/snd/ does have a /dev/snd/midiC3D0 file when I attach the USB (and USB is working fine)
Jul 04 17:22:56 <hexnewbie>	GTK or Qt. Neither are small, hardware acceleration may be unavoidable though I don't seem to recall them requiring it, but you have no other options.

Took me until now to troubleshoot, and none of the "solutions" online worked (as is always the case). I ended up

Jul 04 18:11:33 <mdogg>	I like creating DHCP reservations in my router for all the devices in my house.  That way I know my phone (for example) will always get 192.168.1.202 when I'm at home.  And since all the devices are setup to accept an IP address via DHCP, when I bring my phone to a friends house I can still accept whichever IP his router wants to give me.

Jul 04 18:24:41 <AeonSophia>	the problem is that device based solutions seem to be limited to phones, I don't see how that works for PC (think platforms like Steam that have NSFW content and don't HAVE phone versions)
Jul 04 18:24:45 <johnny>	either way i'm pretty sure it could work on linux just as well on windows if somehow it ever comes ot that
Jul 04 18:24:46 <sysRPX>	i just do not have the builtin vscode terminal showing the std i/o of my programs
Jul 04 18:24:54 <bookworms>	but ya, I'm not working for companies who require my Windows support knowledge anymore.
Jul 04 18:25:14 <bookworms>	They run linux or find someone else.
Jul 04 18:25:19 <johnny>	pell_, nobodyis debating the necessity of virtual machines
Jul 04 18:25:29 <johnny>	just a specific software for running virtual machines
Jul 04 18:25:30 <AeonSophia>	as for Red Hat: it seems very murky what software might be affected based on their decision to take their stuff commercial

Jul 04 18:25:47 <sysRPX>	i was thinking i could use tmux and an external terminal window

Jul 04 18:25:57 <akik>	AeonSophia: it won't be commercial/closed source
Jul 04 18:26:10 <sysRPX>	is there a simple way to configure remote-ssh to use a named tmux session?
Jul 04 18:26:11 <pell_>	I know of people who use VirtualBox the same way I use Qemu
Jul 04 18:26:15 <johnny>	AeonSophia, they can't even do that. those projects are community projects
Jul 04 18:26:34 <johnny>	AeonSophia, the thing you should be worried about is them ust taking away their paid programmers who are working on that stuff

Jul 04 18:28:38 <johnny>	actually systemd is the thing that makes it most easy to translate to some other init system

Jul 04 19:53:34 <rbox>	its guessing
Jul 04 19:53:43 <colo>	FakuVe: files are just streams of bytes. interpreting these files using a certain encoding gives it the meaning you ascribe to "plain text" files
Jul 04 19:53:44 *	ano (~ano@user/ano) has joined
Jul 04 19:53:54 <FakuVe>	So first off. Does a hexdump of a file shows me the metadata of that file?
Jul 04 19:54:00 <lucgagan>	What's the best channel ask questions about DNS?
Jul 04 19:54:02 <rbox>	there is no "metadata" for encoding
Jul 04 19:54:10 <colo>	vim will mediate between the encodings it assumes of files, and your terminal emulator output. that's what `fileencoding` and `termencoding` are for.

Jul 04 19:54:49 <bm>	FakuVe: in most cases there's really nothing indicating an encoding of a file. It's mostly guesswork or defaulting to UTF-8.
Jul 04 19:55:08 <FakuVe>	ok colo , but there are loads of them on iconv --list . It always assumes utf-8 to start with , but say I am using a weird encoding (dont know if there is) that understand the same sequence of bytes in a different way (seamlessly)
Jul 04 19:55:16 <colo>	FakuVe: there's file formats that are more strictly defined than "plain text". so the streams of bytes stored in those files have to follow certain rules for the files to be accepted by parsers.
Jul 04 19:55:52 <FakuVe>	Ok so plain text is defined for not having metadata at all
Jul 04 19:55:53 <colo>	FakuVe: "plain text" (in absence of a BOM) does not have any such metadata, and you live on a) default settings and b) guesswork/heuristics in that case
Jul 04 19:56:06 <FakuVe>	Ok

Jul 04 19:56:20 <akik>	lucgagan: no one can know if you don't ask your question
Jul 04 19:56:32 <FakuVe>	If it would have some metadata , and that plaintext would contain code to be compiled maybe the compiler would mess things up
Jul 04 19:56:34 <colo>	your system has a `locale` setting that also controls the default text encoding many/most modern tools assume as their default
Jul 04 19:56:37 <mdogg>	lucgagan: There is channel called #DNS with about 100 users in it.  You can always ask your question, though.  No harm in asking.
Jul 04 19:56:51 <mdogg>	If there's a better forum someone will let you know.

Jul 04 19:57:16 <FakuVe>	What about DOS encoding , an unix?
Jul 04 19:57:19 <colo>	`iconv` is the glibc subsystem (and an executable that leverages libc-level support of those concepts) that deals with locales and text encodings
Jul 04 19:57:33 <bm>	FakuVe: for example, when rendering webpages, either the server has to specify an encoding or it's explicitly in HTML, e.g. <html charset="utf8">. There's nothing magical anywhere else.
Jul 04 19:57:54 <akik>	FakuVe: dos uses code page 437
Jul 04 19:57:55 <bparker>	there is magic when there's no encoding specified
Jul 04 19:57:58 <colo>	"DOS" is, afaik, just 7-bit ascii with optional codepages, with a certain rule for what represents a "this line ends, a new line begins"-sequence of bytres
Jul 04 19:58:02 <colo>	bytes*
Jul 04 19:58:20 <FakuVe>	alright

Jul 04 19:59:22 <FakuVe>	OK I see yeah
Jul 04 19:59:24 <lucgagan>	I took down my website by trying to use Cloud DNS. Here is what I have done so far:
Jul 04 19:59:24 <lucgagan>	1. I have added a zone to Cloud DNS (GCP) for https://ray.run/
Jul 04 19:59:24 <lucgagan>	2. I have updated my domain registrar to use NS ns-cloud-d1.googledomains.com and d2, d3, s4
Jul 04 19:59:24 <lucgagan>	3. I have enabled DNSSEC in my DNS zone
Jul 04 19:59:24 <lucgagan>	4. I have added DNSSEC records to domain registrar and published them
Jul 04 19:59:25 <lucgagan>	However, at the moment (and it has been a few hours) the website is unreachable. How do I debug/what should I do next?
Jul 04 19:59:33 <FakuVe>	Thanks guys
Jul 04 19:59:35 <mdogg>	lucgagan: Use a pastebin going forward.
Jul 04 19:59:38 <lucgagan>	OK

Jul 04 21:05:30 <greentail>	clemens3, yes, with one byte, biggest number is 2^8-1, but what's a 32-bit word?
Jul 04 21:05:46 <rocks>	4 bytes
Jul 04 21:06:02 <bakerst>	greentail: 'words' are the size of data units that your cpu calculates with natively. so if your cpu has 32-bit registers, you'll have 32-bit words (which are 4 bytes / octets)
Jul 04 21:06:33 <greentail>	bakerst, a byte is the same as an octet?
Jul 04 21:06:34 <bakerst>	now 'word' doesn't imply the data type: it could be a single-precision floating point number, a 32-bit integer signed or unsigned, or something else
Jul 04 21:06:43 <FavoritoHJS>	the 68000, as mentioned before, i think the 6502 often uses big endian (at least as far as it uses 16-bit integers...), I think many early RISC architectures were primarily big endian as well
Jul 04 21:06:48 <bakerst>	yes, a byte is an octet (on today's computers)
Jul 04 21:07:36 <bakerst>	bytes don't have to be 8 bits on all computers, so 'octet' is the exact word for a 8-bit byte

Jul 04 21:48:46 <preach>	it's a way to copy files that are in-use
Jul 04 21:48:50 <preach>	afaik
Jul 04 21:48:50 <mdogg>	Shadow Copy is a technology included in Microsoft Windows that can create backup copies or snapshots of computer files or volumes, even when they are in use. It is implemented as a Windows service called the Volume Shadow Copy service.
Jul 04 21:48:53 <RelayChat>	file system snapshotting for ntfs, basically
Jul 04 21:49:03 <mdogg>	Yeah

Jul 05 00:01:01 <mdogg>	You have to follow the instructions on that page.  And really, that is kind of a guide.  If you're going to compile the kernel from scratch, you may need to make changes to different directories.  I will say that it is a LOT easier to do it these days than it was back in the early 2000's.  But like I said earlier -- it generally is not necessary to have to compile and install the kernel yourself if the Linux distribution you are running is descent.

Jul 05 00:10:17 <mdogg>	That doesn't mean that the Imperial system will completely go away, because obviously there will be car parts and other things that used the Imperial measurements in the past.  So we will always need two sets of tools.  But going forward, it will be /much/ better.
Jul 05 00:10:28 <mquin>	Weird thing in the UK is fuel economy gets quoted in MPG even though fuel gets sold in litres (and we still do road distances in miles despite most other things being metric)

But I don't like cartoons looking like Disney bought them.  Example:  I like watching Space Ghost Coast to Coast, Sealab 2012, Family Guy, and stuff like that.. And I'm sure all of those involved a ton of CG.

Jul 05 04:45:07 <kubuntu>	So earlier today I tried to resize my linux partition, allocating it more space that I had previously taken away from my Windows partition. I have 2 drives: an SSD and an HDD. I set up the SSD to have / and one of the partitions on the HDD to contain my /home directory. I booted into a liveusb, resized the partition using gparted, then booted back into the os. But I found that I could only boot into recovery mode cli and that the
Jul 05 04:45:08 <kubuntu>	/home partition couldnt be mounted. On trying to do an fsck -f on the partition (/dev/sda2) I was informed that I had a "Bad magic number in super-block"

Jul 05 09:18:16 <sozuba>	when one uses mount, is it necessary to use 'mount -o defaults....' if i want defaults, or is it unncessary because its default. Tis question is with respect to both mounting manually for chroot and for fsab entries.

Jul 05 09:28:37 <sozuba>	akik: nothiing of that sort, I was just rtying to understand its significance
Jul 05 09:28:38 <johnny>	soyou don't have to set defaults explicitly if you set nothing else
Jul 05 09:28:42 <jim>	I would assume that he didn't try that, as he would like information first
Jul 05 09:28:50 <akik>	sozuba, i have never used -o defaults when using mount manually
Jul 05 09:29:03 <johnny>	you only use defaults when your'e basically saying.. here's all the options i want

Jul 05 12:31:21 <pydev1>	hello, i need a clarification about permissions... i have a user called "ftp_user" with primary group called "ftp_group" then i have another user called web_user with a group called "web_group", then i also added "ftp_group" as a secondary group of web_user ... Said that when i create a new file with web_user:ftp_group permissions (640 permissions) could anyone explain me how ftp_user can remove that file if i only have "r" as group permission on that file?
Jul 05 12:32:02 <pydev1>	i save that file inside ftp_user /home, but as i said the permissions are web_user:ftp_group rw-r--r--

Jul 05 12:43:31 <pydev1>	so basically i have configured vsftp to use a system user
Jul 05 12:43:39 <pydev1>	that system user is ftp_user:ftp_group
Jul 05 12:44:02 <pydev1>	then as i said i save a file in the server (i have a phop file that save it...so i am not saving thought ftp)
Jul 05 12:44:18 <pydev1>	i add that file and the permissions are web_user:ftp_group
Jul 05 12:44:31 <MrElendig>	pydev1: seriously, don't use ftp

Jul 05 12:45:49 <pydev1>	if i try to save a file via ftp
Jul 05 12:45:50 <MrElendig>	(and you should use virtual users with vsftp if you really want to use ftp, which you shouldn't)
Jul 05 12:45:53 <pydev1>	i see
Jul 05 12:45:55 <pydev1>	one moment...
Jul 05 12:46:01 <akik>	pydev1, you can use ftp. just encrypt the connections
Jul 05 12:46:10 <djph>	sounds like vsftp isn't actually running as who you think it's running as.
Jul 05 12:47:04 <pydev1>	-rw-rw---- 1 ftp_user ftp_group
Jul 05 12:47:10 <djph>	akik: or just use sftp, because it's loads easier, and the protocol doesn't suck :)
Jul 05 12:47:10 <pydev1>	so when i save a file via ftp client
Jul 05 12:47:15 <pydev1>	the permissions on that file are correct

Jul 05 12:50:06 <MrElendig>	systemctl show -pUser,UID,Group,GID vsftp and check the process itself
Jul 05 12:50:45 <pydev1>	if my web_user that has as secondary group the "ftp_grpup" save a file with web_user:ftp_group permissions i CAN  delete it via ftp...
Jul 05 12:50:53 <pydev1>	ok i try MrElendig
Jul 05 12:51:43 <pydev1>	MrElendig, https://bpa.st/HRTK2 ?
Jul 05 12:52:04 <pydev1>	which is correct i mean....because it does not really have ONE permission...it depends on the user is correcting
Jul 05 12:52:08 <pydev1>	so i think it is running as root
Jul 05 12:52:16 <pydev1>	like any other deamon like nginx

Jul 05 13:03:39 <jim>	there are several problems with running an ftpd, and one of those, is all information is sent and received "in clear text" (meaning anyone who's eavesdropping on the ftp connection can read anything that's sent of received), and that includes login names and passwords... ftp is an old protocol, and conventional wisdom states, you snould not run an ftpd, especially one that expects passwords
Jul 05 13:04:06 <jim>	do you really need to run an ftpd? :)
Jul 05 13:04:14 <MrElendig>	for vsftpd it depends on how you have configured it too
Jul 05 13:04:20 <MrElendig>	local vs virtual user etc
Jul 05 13:04:59 <pydev1>	i am using local user
Jul 05 13:05:04 <pydev1>	and i use SSL Connectionk
Jul 05 13:05:07 <pydev1>	so the data is safe
Jul 05 13:05:16 <pydev1>	i know i should avod ftp but it is a legacy project
Jul 05 13:05:20 <pydev1>	cant remove ftp right now
Jul 05 13:05:28 <pydev1>	is there a way to check the problem?
Jul 05 13:05:35 <pydev1>	i mean if a user save a file inside an HOME
Jul 05 13:06:00 <pydev1>	can the user with that HOME remove a file if the permissions are not ftp_user:ftp_Group?
Jul 05 13:06:10 <pydev1>	ust the group but with "r" permissions

Jul 05 13:07:58 <a__>	Alright, so since crypttab/fstab are dangerous and lock me out of my computer at the slightest [non-]error, what was the other method? Running a .sh script at boot with systemd, which consists of what exactly? cryptsetup lines followed by mount lines? What is the benefit of using crypttab/fstab if they are so dangerous and it can be done like this anyway?

Jul 05 14:04:54 <pydev1>	when i save a file via ftp client
Jul 05 14:04:59 <pydev1>	the permissions are ftp_user:ftp_group

Jul 05 14:05:53 <ananke>	pydev1: that wasn't a question. that was the answer to 'why'
Jul 05 14:05:54 <pydev1>	web_user:ftp_group rw-r-r

Jul 05 14:08:17 <pydev1>	the group WITH "r"permissions does not matter
Jul 05 14:08:23 <BillTorvalds2>	In the manual of cryptsetup, it gives this for the VeraCrypt part: "open --type tcrypt <device> <name>" There is no mention of --keyfile or --passphrasefile? Does that mean that it cannot be run in a script after all, since it would require manual input?
Jul 05 14:08:24 <rascul>	pydev1 deleting a file manipulates the directory not the file
Jul 05 14:08:24 <pydev1>	because filesystem uses folder permissions

Jul 05 15:41:40 *	sozuba_ is now known as sozuba
Jul 05 15:41:41 <wigums>	i know that. what im saying is ssh will do everything fail2ban will do
Jul 05 15:41:42 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to litharge
Jul 05 15:41:43 *	litharge sets ban on *!uid609352@2a03:5180:f:4::9:4c48
Jul 05 15:41:43 *	litharge has kicked bator from #linux (Discuss your ban in #linux-ops. (by ayecee))
Jul 05 15:41:43 <Khaytsus>	wigums: fail2ban does way more than just sshd.
Jul 05 15:41:53 *	litharge removes channel operator status from litharge
Jul 05 15:41:56 <wigums>	Khaytsus but my question is about ssh
Jul 05 15:42:11 <ayecee>	ssh doesn't do the things fail2ban does
Jul 05 15:42:18 <Khaytsus>	I didn't offhand know sshd had the ability to block after failed connections
Jul 05 15:42:23 <zdragon>	if you put your internet-facing sshd on a non-default port, you don't need fail2ban as much.
Jul 05 15:42:23 <wigums>	what doesnt it do?
Jul 05 15:42:38 <ayecee>	block repeated authentication attempts
Jul 05 15:42:45 <wigums>	sshd does that
Jul 05 15:42:48 <ayecee>	it doesn't
Jul 05 15:42:51 <wigums>	it does
Jul 05 15:42:53 <ayecee>	it doesn't
Jul 05 15:42:56 <wigums>	k
Jul 05 15:43:03 <zdragon>	pick a good high non-default port, not something like 8000 or 8080.

Jul 05 15:43:45 <Khaytsus>	Yeah looks like sshd does have maxauthtries
Jul 05 15:43:47 <Ecko>	I purposefully leave my ssh on port 22
Jul 05 15:43:57 <ayecee>	maxauthtries in a single connection
Jul 05 15:44:08 <Ecko>	And then have f2b log IP
Jul 05 15:44:09 <Khaytsus>	fail2ban is also per IP
Jul 05 15:44:16 <ayecee>	does not prevent new connections
Jul 05 15:44:18 <Ecko>	for research purposes
Jul 05 15:44:18 *	hyskaru (~hyskaru@user/hyskaru) has joined
Jul 05 15:44:19 <wigums>	it can also limit session count
Jul 05 15:44:23 <zdragon>	on 22, you will get a lot of connection attempts.  these are interesting to watch and/or block the IPs, subnets, or ASNs.
Jul 05 15:44:27 <zdragon>	def for research. :)
Jul 05 15:44:28 <ayecee>	concurrent session count

Jul 05 15:44:36 <wigums>	so yes it does limit connections
Jul 05 15:44:46 <ayecee>	doesn't limit repeated connections
Jul 05 15:44:52 <wigums>	it sure does
Jul 05 15:44:55 <ayecee>	nope
Jul 05 15:44:59 <wigums>	whatever
Jul 05 15:45:23 <zdragon>	to confuse dumb attackers put it on the telnet port
Jul 05 15:45:29 <Khaytsus>	wigums: How do you set the timeframe?

Jul 05 15:46:01 <rascul>	fail2ban is good at keeping log noise down
Jul 05 15:46:20 <Khaytsus>	fail2ban also has recidive which is handy..  if someone gets unbanned, then tries again, it'll ban them quicker.

Jul 05 17:32:00 <BillTorvalds3>	Problem: "sudo cryptsetup open --type tcrypt /dev/sda disk_two --key-file /home/a/Documents/nothinghere" still asks for a passphrase, even when providing the --key-file which the manpage doesn't even mention for the tcrypt section at all... The manpage also says "Because TCRYPT header is encrypted, you have to always provide valid passphrase and keyfiles.", but what do they mean by this? Passphrase *AND* keyfileS?! There is *only* a passphrase
Jul 05 17:32:00 <BillTorvalds3>	for VeraCrypt, and I'm providing it in the keyfile! Why does it still ask for a passphrase interactively? (This command is supposed to run in a startup script.)

So when you enter the passphrase, you are decrypting it and storing that in RAM for later use. Maybe there is also a key file here implied somehow somewhere, and you just don't know where it is.

Jul 05 20:04:44 <BillTorvalds3>	Those "arrow" things are new to me.
Jul 05 20:04:47 <BillTorvalds3>	Never saw those before.
Jul 05 20:04:49 <neoncortex>	wigums: the cube is still there?
Jul 05 20:04:53 <wigums>	oh yea
Jul 05 20:04:56 <katp32>	compiz is awesome
Jul 05 20:04:57 <ursa>	BillTorvalds3: as long as you find out what sda *currently* is, then you can use its path
Jul 05 20:04:58 <neoncortex>	heh
Jul 05 20:05:05 <katp32>	I mean I would never use it, it kills your performance
Jul 05 20:05:06 <BillTorvalds3>	ursa: Indeed. That's how I understood it.
Jul 05 20:05:10 <ursa>	the path will not change, unless you change your motherboard
Jul 05 20:05:13 <katp32>	but jiggly windows!!
Jul 05 20:05:16 <ursa>	or switch cables
Jul 05 20:05:17 <Khaytsus>	compizz and rotating cubes was neat in like 2004 when I only had a single monitor :D

Jul 05 20:06:24 <Khaytsus>	What was beryl, a compizz alternative?   I remember it vaguely.
Jul 05 20:06:31 <ursa>	BillTorvalds3: those arrow things are also explained in the debian reference manual, probably
Jul 05 20:06:35 <stenno>	yeah that cube thing
Jul 05 20:06:45 <stenno>	i think it was an alternative, yes
Jul 05 20:06:49 <katp32>	jiggly windows > the cube
Jul 05 20:06:58 <stenno>	lol

Jul 05 20:07:13 <Khaytsus>	I even used to have all my alternative windows like 50% opacity and the cube low opacity so I could see through everything and read windows on the side.  It was silly.
Jul 05 20:07:24 <Khaytsus>	there was SOME real functional use cases, but mostly it was just silly

Jul 05 20:08:03 <hexnewbie>	GNOME's eyecandy is quite nice
Jul 05 20:08:03 <MrElendig>	"by-id also creates World Wide Name links of storage devices that support it. Unlike other by-id links, WWNs are fully persistent and will not change depending on the used subsystem."  sadly those are generally not marked physically on the drive
Jul 05 20:08:04 <Khaytsus>	I still use transparent windows and will sometimes read through them to hte underlying window
Jul 05 20:08:16 <MrElendig>	also most storage devices does nto support them :/
Jul 05 20:08:19 <suid_dumpable>	Khaytsus: remember the non-rectangular shaped skips for xmms? (or was it a different mp3 player?)
Jul 05 20:08:20 <Khaytsus>	hexnewbie: I think of gnome as needing eye bleach, not candy
Jul 05 20:08:26 <katp32>	GNOME's eyecandy also causes memory leaks and toilet grade performance though
Jul 05 20:08:28 <MrElendig>	but nice when they do
Jul 05 20:08:29 <suid_dumpable>	*skins
Jul 05 20:08:40 <Khaytsus>	suid_dumpable: Oh yes, I remember those skins.
Jul 05 20:08:43 <katp32>	so it's like compiz except it performs worse AND it's not as cool
Jul 05 20:08:49 <neoncortex>	oh yeah there was all sorts of skins to xmms/audacious.
Jul 05 20:08:51 <katp32>	they should just go back to compiz smh
Jul 05 20:08:54 <hexnewbie>	I don't think it looking marginally better/worse is the reason it an app starts 3.5 times slower with the new release

Jul 05 20:11:42 <BillTorvalds3>	Small note: mount doesn't recognize "ntfs3" as the type; only "ntfs". So there is no "faster and better" version you can pick there. I mention this just because I heard a discussion related to this a while ago.
Jul 05 20:11:50 <MrElendig>	nautilus doesn't poke those mounts until I actually click on them
Jul 05 20:12:05 <ursa>	BillTorvalds3: because you're on debian

Jul 05 21:12:16 *	BillTorvalds3 (~BillTorva@user/BillTorvalds) has joined
Jul 05 21:12:43 <fork2zombe>	what decision?
Jul 05 21:12:47 <RelayChat>	synchronous i/o is essentially "baked" into the linux kernel, isn't it?
Jul 05 21:13:33 <BillTorvalds3>	katp32: "what does Linux's NTFS support have to do with running a Windows VM on Linux?" <-- I have VMware Workstation Player running on Linux (Debian 12). The VM files are located on my NTFS disk (VeraCrypted). In that way, it is related.
Jul 05 21:13:33 <kfrench>	I think you need to describe what you mean by synchronous.  Even then, there isn't anyone here that can explain the nuances enough to answer your questions.
Jul 05 21:13:47 <RelayChat>	user-mode programmers can do async i/o but the kernel itself is sort of hardwired with synchronous i/o because of unix legacy, no?
Jul 05 21:14:14 <BillTorvalds3>	The Task manager in Xfce doesn't say anything about I/O usage. I would love to see I/O stats. What is the best way to determine that in Linux?
Jul 05 21:14:41 *	bud (~bud@user/bud) has left (Leaving.)
Jul 05 21:14:42 <BillTorvalds3>	Would also be cool with a GPU column, besides I/O.
Jul 05 21:14:52 <kfrench>	The kernel will submit requests to the disks through its various internal APIs.  It's all event driven.  Once the relavent data is read from disk, the kernel makes sure the data is in the correct buffers and returns to user space
Jul 05 21:14:53 <RelayChat>	BillTorvalds3: htop?
Jul 05 21:14:54 <BillTorvalds3>	The Task manager only has CPU usage and RAM usage.
Jul 05 21:14:58 <bparker>	RelayChat: yes, ioctl's of course are synchronous and can be used for bidirectional communication with kernel modules
Jul 05 21:15:19 <BillTorvalds3>	RelayChat: How come it isn't installed by default?

Jul 05 21:18:06 <Wout>	install hardinfo it pretty good
Jul 05 21:18:38 <fork2zombe>	for htop you have to go into the setup menu and enable the IO_READ_RATE and IO_WRITE_RATE
Jul 05 21:19:02 <fork2zombe>	setup --> columns

Jul 05 21:19:09 <kfrench>	Nothing inside the kernel "blocks" on waiting for disk io.  So, no.  It's not synchronous inside the kernel.  The kernel will block the userspace thread while it waits on the I/O.
Jul 05 21:19:13 <ursa>	BillTorvalds3: iotop
Jul 05 21:19:54 <ursa>	Also why would anything be installed by default, instead of bare minimum and then letting the user decide? This isn't windows.

Jul 05 22:50:08 <neoncortex>	circuitbone: generally I paste into an acme scratch window.  You may use emacs scratch buffer, or a vim buffer, or whatever.
Jul 05 22:50:34 <circuitbone>	works for me mate as long as you have that extra step
Jul 05 22:50:54 <ursa>	monkeyPlus: yes, if you compromise a user that is root-equivalent, then you become root
Jul 05 22:51:07 <monkeyPlus>	what is root-equivalent?!

Jul 05 22:51:31 <ursa>	a user that can gain root privileges using sudo without having to put in a password

Jul 05 22:55:57 <Khaytsus>	sudo allowing users to use their own password lets you remove ONE user from having root access vs N users.  Making it use the root password is kinda of pointless.  Just use su if you're going to do that.

Jul 05 23:41:12 <wigums>	still get ads
Jul 05 23:41:16 <phogg>	ad block by DNS blacklisting aka "supertrick" has been around forever. It's not the best option, but it beats doing nothing
Jul 05 23:41:58 <phogg>	I've been doing that at my local network DNS server level for two decades
Jul 05 23:42:24 <wigums>	i see very few ads like none and i dont use pihole
Jul 05 23:42:38 <wigums>	i found pihole does very little
Jul 05 23:43:00 <phogg>	can't agree with your observations

Jul 05 23:43:29 <zen_desu>	does dns adblocking still work that well? I used to do that but i redid my network and haven't set up my own bind server with a blockist again, and i barely notice a difference lol
Jul 05 23:43:37 <zen_desu>	esp on mobile devices
Jul 05 23:43:44 <zen_desu>	my android phone barely even respects the dns info from dhcp

Jul 05 23:44:17 <phogg>	zen_desu: in the arms race between good and evil, the evil side (advertisers) have been getting smarter and doing things like not using a separate IP/domain for ads. When that happens blocking options become more limited.

Jul 05 23:44:30 <zen_desu>	phogg: my thoughts
Jul 05 23:44:36 <zen_desu>	5 years ago dns ablocking was much better
Jul 05 23:44:43 <Sabotender>	say you've got a Samsung TV that has been filling your homescreen with non-stop adverts for various titles, because they want your money, you can make it go away with such a blacklist. You can apply it to your iPhone, and they've got pisspoor content blockers within their appstore. And you can use it to block forced updates for numerous reasons.
Jul 05 23:44:44 <phogg>	wigums: I assume you use some other strategy instead. The advantage of dns blacklisting can be felt mostly when you don't employ other strategies.
Jul 05 23:44:46 <johnny>	i just haven't botehred with dns blocking because almost all the blocking i want to do is what hapensi nthe browser anyways
Jul 05 23:44:47 <zen_desu>	now sometimes you can't block ads with just IP/DNS
Jul 05 23:44:52 <wigums>	where are all these ads coming from?
Jul 05 23:45:05 <johnny>	Sabotender, not when they switch to dns over https

Jul 05 23:45:31 <zen_desu>	the main reason i even used a blocklist was because the script i used also blocked malware donaims

Jul 05 23:46:16 <neshpion>	i heard of a potential ad-blocking strategy that would basically have the whole un-blocked page load in the background, so that any ad-block-blocker code would think you're being a good little attention slave, and then it would present the user with a sanitized version of the page
Jul 05 23:46:18 <zen_desu>	my  roku based smart tv is kinda nice on a network level
Jul 05 23:46:18 <ssm_>	twitch is really insideous with its ads, since it's a livestreaming site, they can bake ads directly into the video stream
Jul 05 23:46:26 <zen_desu>	but most of what it does is connect to my plex server over lan :))
Jul 05 23:46:46 <phogg>	neshpion: that still eats resources and may still impact privacy
Jul 05 23:46:48 <zen_desu>	nice as in it doeasn't do things that are too horrible
Jul 05 23:46:59 <neshpion>	ssm_: and they recently forbid content creators from doing the same... because twitch can't intercept the revenue x.x

Jul 05 23:47:18 *	hyperr1 (~hyper@user/hyperr) has joined
Jul 05 23:47:32 <phogg>	neshpion: the reasons to block ads are usually because they consume bandwidth/RAM/CPU, secondarily to prevent tracking. Just not wanting to look at them is rarely important.
Jul 05 23:47:36 <zen_desu>	wigums: dns adblocking barely works in [cirrent year]
Jul 05 23:47:46 <neshpion>	phogg: resources yes, but combined with anti-fingerprinting strategies like click-everything-in-the-background, i think i'd use it if youtube/google/alphabet tries to kill adblocking

Jul 05 23:48:30 <zen_desu>	yeah so at that end, what are you expecting from pihole?
Jul 05 23:48:39 <circuitbone>	adblock list wellsprings are used by both adblock extensions and dns sinkhole solutions
Jul 05 23:48:42 <phogg>	zen_desu: better than nothing.
Jul 05 23:48:50 <zen_desu>	yes better than nothing
Jul 05 23:48:57 <zen_desu>	i'd say the main advantage is having a caching dns server on lan

Jul 06 02:36:53 <Ogobaga>	what `find -maxdepth 1 -type d` you mean?

Jul 06 02:37:57 <Blondie101010>	but find's syntax is quite extensive
Jul 06 02:38:00 <johnny>	or the one in the topic
Jul 06 02:38:04 <jjakob>	BaconV2: personally I prefer 0x0.st (you can use it with curl)
Jul 06 02:38:07 <Blondie101010>	and you know need to learn all parameters for all commands you use
Jul 06 02:38:12 <Blondie101010>	that would be wasted
Jul 06 02:38:19 <johnny>	Blondie101010, that's not true at all. i don't know all the params to find !
Jul 06 02:38:24 <mdogg>	Oh yeah - most people use https://paste.linux.chat/ -
Jul 06 02:38:32 <johnny>	i know what i could do with find, but i don't know them by heart

Jul 06 02:39:11 <Blondie101010>	I did make a mistake
Jul 06 02:39:32 <rascul>	mdogg termbin.com is overwhelmingly the most popular here according to my logs

Jul 06 02:40:05 <jjakob>	so I start gpg-agent in ~/.bashrc and then in ~/.xinitrc I "dbus-launch dwm" but gpg-agent spawns pinentry-gtk which needs dbus env to display the pinentry prompt

Jul 06 02:43:55 <johnny>	BaconV2, you're gonna have to ask in a different place than this i'm pretty sure. this ins't a linux issue but a hardware doc issue
Jul 06 02:44:08 <johnny>	i thought i'd do a quick search to see if anybody else had discovered it, but it's not the case
Jul 06 02:44:13 <BaconV2>	so does that looks like the ram address, before I go?
Jul 06 02:44:22 <BaconV2>	I'm fairly new to this
Jul 06 02:44:46 <johnny>	there's not a single other mention of ram in the entire file.
Jul 06 02:44:53 <Blondie101010>	Ogobaga:  it would show you how to use man and to get your answer
Jul 06 02:45:02 <BaconV2>	it must be that then
Jul 06 02:45:04 <johnny>	we can only assume it's attached to the i2s bus, but we don't actually know that 100%
Jul 06 02:45:08 <Blondie101010>	should take 5 seconds if you've used find search before
Jul 06 02:45:10 <johnny>	but it probably is
Jul 06 02:45:11 <Blondie101010>	so learn it!
Jul 06 02:45:17 <Blondie101010>	man*
Jul 06 02:45:19 <Ogobaga>	Blondie101010: too much work.
Jul 06 02:45:24 <Blondie101010>	in man, you can search with /
Jul 06 02:45:33 <Blondie101010>	like in less

Jul 06 02:46:08 <BaconV2>	so like you say, if I can basically list the addresses of the devices in there and look for blank spots, I might find where that second ram port is?
Jul 06 02:46:09 <mquin>	Ogobaga: this in your loop might do what you're after: cd "${i%/}" && zip -r "../${i%/}.zip" . && cd -
Jul 06 02:46:12 <Blondie101010>	so `man find`, then /-maxdepth
Jul 06 02:46:18 <mdogg>	And 'n' will go to the next search result.
Jul 06 02:46:32 <Blondie101010>	there you immediately get the official answer
Jul 06 02:46:50 <johnny>	BaconV2, that's what i'd try, but you could also perhaps look up who committed that device to linux and ask them
Jul 06 02:47:15 <BaconV2>	unfortunately that second choice isn't going to be an option

Jul 06 02:47:40 <elkclone>	Don't feed the trolls. :D
Jul 06 02:47:44 <BaconV2>	there are a few, one is called the LeMaker Guitar
Jul 06 02:47:47 <Blondie101010>	also easy to search google for man pages, except for `man find`
Jul 06 02:47:50 <Blondie101010>	that never works! :)

Jul 06 02:49:18 <johnny>	BaconV2, actually tho.. i realize something

Jul 06 03:45:02 <zen_desu>	any reason you're not just using tar?
Jul 06 03:45:22 <zen_desu>	i think with tar you can target a dir, and then you don't actually need to be cd'ing
Jul 06 03:46:09 <Blondie101010>	which would be similar to Ogobaga's approach
Jul 06 03:46:21 <Blondie101010>	he wants them by dir
Jul 06 03:46:48 <ionpulse>	I was just providing an example to help Ogobaga with his use case. I have scripts I wrote for packing data, which allows me to choose tar, rar, zip, 7z, takes into account volumes, creating an accompanying .sfv file, etc.
Jul 06 03:46:59 <rocks>	tar also has command line options for stripping path elements
Jul 06 03:47:09 <ionpulse>	Here I was just providing a boilerplate example for not including the parent dir in the archive, when targeting a folder to pack.

Jul 06 04:26:05 <zen_desu>	zen4 has some special optimizations
Jul 06 04:26:07 <johnny>	ghostbuster, the real reason to use gentoo is if you want some idea of how your linux system actually works and how things are put together

Jul 06 04:26:15 <johnny>	epecially if you kind of following along with lfs at the same time
Jul 06 04:26:20 <rocks>	Once it's built, the tools are there and you need to use them for something
Jul 06 04:26:29 <BaconV2>	It seems the cpu communicates to the ram over i2c, so... apparently an i2c bus scan will detect devices connected by that communication method
Jul 06 04:26:39 <zen_desu>	yeah i mean i use gentoo because i like to have a good grip on what my system is doing, like i make my initramfs myself, i do most of the netowrking just using "ip" but also netifrc helps
Jul 06 04:26:40 <johnny>	did i know what glibc did, or why you had to compile a compiler TWICE before i used gentoo ghostbuster . nope.. but after that i did
Jul 06 04:26:48 <zen_desu>	and also im not a huge systemd fan, that is the real reason
Jul 06 04:27:01 <zen_desu>	i mean not "real reason" but a big one, i use alpine too

Jul 06 04:27:08 <rocks>	i2c is slow af and mostly used for EEPROM and stuff like that rather than RAM
Jul 06 04:27:14 <Sabotender>	it's all about that certain feeling of success and accomplishment you receive when you've completed the compilation  without error

Jul 06 04:28:25 <zen_desu>	also note that even operc uses udev now
Jul 06 04:28:27 <ghostbuster>	the rest of systemd is bloat imho
Jul 06 04:28:28 <johnny>	no, it's the other parts i like the most.. barring the optional stuff like homed and networkd.. which i haven't used
Jul 06 04:28:41 <zen_desu>	so it has a lil bit of systemd in the oppenrc profiles
Jul 06 04:28:43 <johnny>	i think i'm finally using timesync.. not sure.. but all of that is optional
Jul 06 04:28:51 <rocks>	systemd-networkd actually isn't bad. timesyncd and resolved can die in a fire though
Jul 06 04:29:04 <ghostbuster>	i don't mind udev, i'm more annoyed with stuff like journald, resolvd, bootloaderd, homed, whateverd
Jul 06 04:29:07 <johnny>	huh? isn't timesyncd fine on a regular single user system?
Jul 06 04:29:15 <johnny>	ghostbuster, but the journal is the best part of systemd
Jul 06 04:29:27 <rocks>	Might be fine if you only want to use 1 NTP server
Jul 06 04:29:28 <johnny>	resolved and homed are totally optional tho

Jul 06 04:30:20 <johnny>	although resolvd is again, very optional and it's not hard to turn off :)
Jul 06 04:30:32 <johnny>	and certainly wouldn't come on a gentoo install by default
Jul 06 04:30:37 <mdogg>	nxpp: Download htop - it's pretty cool.
Jul 06 04:30:46 <johnny>	is there something better than htop yet..
Jul 06 04:30:47 <rocks>	Linux has long needed something which can handle DNS for split-tunnel VPNs, but all the rest of the junk that resolved breaks means it's best off gone
Jul 06 04:30:50 <bparker>	btop
Jul 06 04:30:54 <nxpp>	how about systemct status?
Jul 06 04:30:56 <ghostbuster>	ah beat me to it
Jul 06 04:31:01 <mdogg>	I prefer htop over btop.
Jul 06 04:31:02 <ghostbuster>	johnny: btop
Jul 06 04:31:03 <Sabotender>	what did you have avagainst systemd, again? did it have something about POSIX?
Jul 06 04:31:16 <johnny>	in this case i's just the optional stuff that's not required for the most part.
Jul 06 04:31:18 <ghostbuster>	i am not a fan of binary log formats
Jul 06 04:31:21 <johnny>	the journal is the only main part

Jul 06 04:31:24 <johnny>	i just want structured logging
Jul 06 04:31:27 *	rocks gzips ghostbusters logs
Jul 06 04:31:28 <zen_desu>	yeah i mean part of why i like openrc over systemd is because i feel like im adding parts, not removing junk, when i make my system
Jul 06 04:31:40 <johnny>	and syslog can't give me that
Jul 06 04:31:45 <zen_desu>	and yeah systemd logging is another thing for me, i prefer log files lol
Jul 06 04:31:56 <mdogg>	rocks: Don't cross the streams.
Jul 06 04:32:01 <zen_desu>	which syslog?

Jul 06 04:33:31 <Sabotender>	I only care about logs as long as they are intuitive, and not needlessly taking up disk space.
Jul 06 04:34:08 <rocks>	and logrotate and its wacky config files won't be missed
Jul 06 04:34:35 <johnny>	is there a popular distro that replaces sudo with something simpler?
Jul 06 04:34:49 <ayecee>	what, like su?
Jul 06 04:34:51 <junyx>	johnny alias sudo="s"
Jul 06 04:34:51 <johnny>	or perhaps more directly expressive if not simpler
Jul 06 04:34:55 <johnny>	lol
Jul 06 04:34:57 <mdogg>	haha
Jul 06 04:34:58 <rbox>	johnny: you need a whole new dist just to use somethign other than sudo?
Jul 06 04:34:58 <zen_desu>	i use syslog-ng and it makes it relativel easy to make a new logging filter/stream, plugs into tons of sutff, and setting up logrotate is so easy, and on top of that, i can use btrfs to snapshot and backup my log dir
Jul 06 04:35:09 <johnny>	rbox, no? i jus wondered :)
Jul 06 04:35:21 <zen_desu>	it all fits together pretty nicely imo

Jul 06 04:35:41 <rbox>	jsut to use doas?
Jul 06 04:35:47 <rocks>	sudo is never used for anything to do with the system, so if you don't like it you can just remove it

Jul 06 04:36:41 <zen_desu>	johnny: alpine
Jul 06 04:36:48 <johnny>	i just wondered if some distro had chosen not to ship sudo and shipped some alternative
Jul 06 04:36:57 <zen_desu>	alpine :)
Jul 06 04:36:58 <johnny>	by default*
Jul 06 04:37:05 <ayecee>	pretty much just su and sudo out there.
Jul 06 04:37:07 <johnny>	zen_desu, what do they ship? if they don't ship sudo at all it doesn't count
Jul 06 04:37:09 <zen_desu>	doas
Jul 06 04:37:15 <johnny>	ah they do ship doas
Jul 06 04:37:29 <johnny>	so. how about a more desktop oriented distro then?
Jul 06 04:37:34 <ayecee>	nope
Jul 06 04:37:45 <Sabotender>	do you mean 'sudo su'?
Jul 06 04:37:45 <zen_desu>	alpine is basically doas + busybox + linux + apk + lbu
Jul 06 04:37:49 *	nxpp has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jul 06 04:37:56 <zen_desu>	and no alpine is a minimal security focused distro
Jul 06 04:37:57 <johnny>	Sabotender, something like this https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas
Jul 06 04:37:59 <zen_desu>	oh and openrc
Jul 06 04:38:01 <rocks>	`sudo su` is something that should never be seen

Jul 06 04:44:34 <zen_desu>	that too
Jul 06 04:44:52 <zen_desu>	i think on gentoo, it autoinstalls a cron job in cron.daily
Jul 06 04:45:07 <ayecee>	in context i think it is the same, actually.
Jul 06 04:45:19 <johnny>	i would assume if you installed something like nginx or apache it'd suggest that it oculd benefit from logrotate

Jul 06 04:45:28 <johnny>	and pop one of those configs in
Jul 06 04:45:31 <zen_desu>	or without cron being instlaled for that matter lol

Jul 06 04:47:15 <zen_desu>	after all a lot of distros are netinstalled now

Jul 06 04:48:51 <ayecee>	what do you think would be a reasonable meaning for it to have
Jul 06 04:48:57 <circuitbone>	ship with usually denotes as in physical location logistics would mean local drive installer bundled

Jul 06 06:30:03 <NeilRG>	zen_desu, I want to run the lemonade server.  I'm trying nohup, but no luck
Jul 06 06:30:03 <Guest49>	Clarify please
Jul 06 06:30:13 <zen_desu>	NeilRG: what is the actual issue?
Jul 06 06:30:16 <fork2zombe>	spam_routine_0347();
Jul 06 06:30:27 <NeilRG>	zen_desu, I tried "nohup lemonade server &> /dev/null &"
Jul 06 06:30:32 <zen_desu>	and i think when you use & it's your shell returning that pid info
Jul 06 06:30:37 <NeilRG>	I'm using zsh
Jul 06 06:30:41 <zen_desu>	no just do nohum lemonade server
Jul 06 06:30:46 <NeilRG>	nohum?
Jul 06 06:30:46 <zen_desu>	nohup lemonade server
Jul 06 06:30:49 <zen_desu>	you don't need the &
Jul 06 06:31:09 <NeilRG>	then it doesn't terminate
Jul 06 06:31:16 <NeilRG>	I want to run this in my zshrc
Jul 06 06:31:23 <zen_desu>	oh then you probably want tmux
Jul 06 06:31:29 <NeilRG>	what's the command?
Jul 06 06:31:35 <NeilRG>	not available lol
Jul 06 06:31:39 <NeilRG>	this should be simpler
Jul 06 06:32:06 *	abs3nt has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
Jul 06 06:32:10 <zen_desu>	tmux will let you run a command in a session that can be reattached to or killed or whatever
Jul 06 06:32:25 <zen_desu>	and when running a service, you generally want something sensible to wrap it
Jul 06 06:32:29 <zen_desu>	often an init script
Jul 06 06:32:38 <zen_desu>	i use tmux to start weechat on login
Jul 06 06:33:01 <NeilRG>	zen_desu, How about this? "(nohup lemonade server &) >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
Jul 06 06:33:01 <NeilRG>	"
Jul 06 06:33:34 *	tkimball_ (tkimball@linuxhq/tkimball) has joined
Jul 06 06:34:05 <zen_desu>	why are you piping stuff to /dev/null?
Jul 06 06:34:18 <zen_desu>	and you generally do nohup or &
Jul 06 06:34:38 <rocks>	If you really really do want to start a command and not hear from it again, you may want to use 'disown' to detach it from the terminal
Jul 06 06:34:45 <rocks>	There are much better ways of doing this in general though
Jul 06 06:35:14 <zen_desu>	actually you can do both, but it will still print that pid that annyos you
Jul 06 06:35:18 <NeilRG>	zen_desu, because I want zero output or zsh will complain that zshrc is printing things
Jul 06 06:35:20 <zen_desu>	you probably want tmux or something
Jul 06 06:35:23 <zen_desu>	yeah
Jul 06 06:35:29 <NeilRG>	yeah but I don't want to install even more programs
Jul 06 06:35:36 <NeilRG>	because I'l have to do that on all muachines
Jul 06 06:35:41 <rocks>	process &>/dev/null & disown

Jul 06 06:36:27 <zen_desu>	it works well
Jul 06 06:36:32 <zen_desu>	and it's nice because you can reattach and stuff
Jul 06 06:36:42 <zen_desu>	especially useful when running a server type of thing
Jul 06 06:37:01 <zen_desu>	tmux new-session -d -s weechat weechat

Currently I am doing it like this `xsetroot -xcf /usr/local/share/icons/redglass/cursors/top_left_arrow 64` I use freebsd 13.2 but I am hopeful this
Jul 06 10:44:57 <Beladona>	is same in Linux as well as I also use ubuntu.

Jul 06 11:54:13 <Spring>	Is there some CLI tool that can do drive data scrubbing/reading back content to check for bad sectors? Need something that can be scheduled for non-RAID drives,
Jul 06 11:54:48 <hexnewbie>	Of course the Samba is the domain controller, and uses its own LDAP server. Joining an AD domain is a different task.
Jul 06 11:54:59 <Beladona>	same issue here like I have in awesomewm https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=264003
Jul 06 11:55:11 <betsch>	in docker - when logging to journald - with "--log-opt labels=cluster1" and "--label cluster1=true" I can give log entries a label which I can then query with "journalctl cluster1=true", is there a way I can add log entries to journald using logger/systemd-cat or any other method?
Jul 06 11:55:18 <hexnewbie>	Spring: badblocks but scheduling that will be quite odd; consider smartctl -t long (should be scheduled by default)
Jul 06 11:55:18 <ananke>	Spring: badblocks perhaps
Jul 06 11:56:15 <hexnewbie>	Admittedly, drive should detect sectors needing reallocation during a badblocks run quite fine, possibly better so than during a long test (full disclosure: I have no idea what a long test does; i.e. does it read all sectors or not)

Jul 06 12:18:09 <hexnewbie>	“Fix”? Best I've gotten it to do was refuse to import the drive completely, for good

Jul 06 12:18:16 <hexnewbie>	Checksum error = death
Jul 06 12:19:25 <mdogg>	I know 'diskscan' will do the job, though.  But like akik mentioned, on an 18TB disk it will likely take days.
Jul 06 12:19:31 <MrElendig>	run a fs with full data checksuming so that you can at least detect when it gets bad
Jul 06 12:19:45 <MrElendig>	so that you don't end up just overwriting our backup with a bad copy
Jul 06 12:19:59 <MrElendig>	unknowingly
Jul 06 12:20:25 <hexnewbie>	Yeah, that's good. But I still prefer it with redundancy.
Jul 06 12:20:27 <Spring>	the only fs that has that though to my knowledge is zfs which is a rabbit hole of pre-planning and RAIDZ configs

Jul 06 12:21:07 <mdogg>	MrElendig is correct.  The file system you use will play a huge role in keeping your data intact.

It needs to detect the boxes of text, images, recognize the text and paragraphs, turn into an ODT. OCRFeeder advertises it does that, but it doesn't work (doesn't support multilanguage despite tesseract supporting, so even basic option passing to the OCR engine is broken; the exported ODT is junk, e.g. 14 pt font is set at
Jul 06 12:53:17 <hexnewbie>	422pt)

Jul 06 13:19:37 <akik>	hexnewbie, why does nmcli show the bridge interface if it's not created/managed with networkmanager?

Jul 06 13:20:13 <rendar>	but why i need initram update?
Jul 06 13:20:26 <hexnewbie>	akik: I don't know if it does or does not, I don't have NetworkManager on machines with bridges, let alone manual bridges. But it's an interface, why wouldn't it see it? It sees ens3, and it didn't create ens3
Jul 06 13:20:38 <akik>	MrElendig, if it can't be managed with nmcli

Jul 06 13:21:45 <MrElendig>	rendar: you can probably replace that tee with tmpfiles.d
Jul 06 13:21:47 <ananke>	rendar: because the module is loaded via the initrd
Jul 06 13:21:47 <Khaytsus>	Seems silly to make an rc.local for that..  You could just do that in a config in modprobe.d
Jul 06 13:22:01 <Khaytsus>	And as said; rebuild initramfs so it gets that info.
Jul 06 13:22:08 <MrElendig>	or modprobe if its a module option, yes
Jul 06 13:22:37 *	hexnewbie is slightly confused on how it's loaded by initramfs but not available when rc-local starts, whenever that is
Jul 06 13:22:50 *	yoozik has quit (Quit: WeeChat 4.0.1)
Jul 06 13:22:56 <rendar>	ananke, but if i put some conf file in /etc/modprobe.d directory, shouldn't that be automatically loaded when the linux kernel driver is loaded?
Jul 06 13:22:59 <hexnewbie>	Might be worth checking if it is loaded at all
Jul 06 13:23:23 <Khaytsus>	rendar: Not if it's loaded at initramfs time
Jul 06 13:23:27 <ananke>	rendar: depends on when that driver is being loaded
Jul 06 13:23:28 <rendar>	i see
Jul 06 13:23:39 <rendar>	so its always better to upate initram
Jul 06 13:23:42 *	hyperair has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
Jul 06 13:23:50 <ananke>	as a rule of thumb, yes.
Jul 06 13:24:16 <rendar>	but what `sudo update-initramfs -u -k all` exactly does? rebuild all kernel drivers with new info inside?

Jul 06 13:25:38 <MrElendig>	it rebuilds the initrd
Jul 06 13:25:45 <ananke>	it doesn't 'rebuild drivers'. it bundles them into initrd
Jul 06 13:25:47 <MrElendig>	it doesn't actually compile anything

Jul 06 13:26:49 <chiselfuse>	I used Kali Linux a while ago and I really liked the default configuration for zsh used there. Does anyone know how I'd go about finding that config? It's a bit too complicated for me now to download the iso and live boot it to extract it from there

Jul 06 13:29:26 *	Harry has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jul 06 13:29:45 <peetaur>	it's the kernel modules and scripts and things it thinks you need at boot time
Jul 06 13:30:30 *	FuturePilot (~Fufu@user/futurepilot) has joined
Jul 06 13:30:33 <peetaur>	so for example a netboot image likely has nfs, network drivers, etc, but maybe not even a disk controller; but a desktop might not have the network driver in it, but instead has the disk controller
Jul 06 13:30:46 <rendar>	i see
Jul 06 13:30:54 *	anzkol87 has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
Jul 06 13:30:58 <rendar>	but there is a dedicated filesystem for that? initram..fs?
Jul 06 13:31:28 <peetaur>	the fs temporary and virtual just from that archive... and then pivot root changes from using that to your real rootfs later in the boot sequence
