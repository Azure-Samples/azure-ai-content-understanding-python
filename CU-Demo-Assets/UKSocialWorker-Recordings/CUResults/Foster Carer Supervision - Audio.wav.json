2>Hello, Jenny.\n\n00:06.720 --> 00:07.760\n<v Speaker 2>I'm well, thank you.\n\n00:07.760 --> 00:08.320\n<v Speaker 2>How about you?\n\n00:09.120 --> 00:10.640\n<v Speaker 1>Yeah, I'm doing well, thank you.\n\n00:10.960 --> 00:12.000\n<v Speaker 1>How is everything?\n\n00:12.160 --> 00:13.880\n<v Speaker 1>Has Jane started to settle now?\n\n00:14.480 --> 00:17.840\n<v Speaker 2>Yeah, she seems happy and settled at the moment, which is great to see.\n\n00:18.320 --> 00:19.440\n<v Speaker 1>Oh, that's great to hear.\n\n00:20.240 --> 00:22.000\n<v Speaker 2>Generally, her mood is positive.\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:24.360\n<v Speaker 2>She doesn't complain about much at all.\n\n00:24.360 --> 00:26.160\n<v Speaker 1>Oh, and that's really great to hear, Susan.\n\n00:26.720 --> 00:28.480\n<v Speaker 1>How is she health-wise?\n\n00:29.040 --> 00:31.760\n<v Speaker 1>Any concerns or recent illnesses?\n\n00:32.560 --> 00:34.240\n<v Speaker 2>Nothing to report at this stage.\n\n00:34.240 --> 00:40.880\n<v Speaker 2>She is generally fit and healthy, although we have noticed some secret binge eating, but in general, she is her happy self.\n\n00:41.280 --> 00:44.960\n<v Speaker 2>Touch wood, she hasn't been unwell recently.\n\n00:45.440 --> 00:47.680\n<v Speaker 2>She hasn't had any bad episodes of asthma.\n\n00:48.080 --> 00:52.120\n<v Speaker 2>We had an appointment last week with a consultant for a checkup and everything was fine.\n\n00:53.200 --> 00:54.080\n<v Speaker 1>Oh, right, okay.\n\n00:54.800 --> 00:56.720\n<v Speaker 1>Has she been managing her asthma okay?\n\n00:57.040 --> 00:58.400\n<v Speaker 2>Yeah, she's been really good.\n\n00:58.400 --> 01:05.360\n<v Speaker 2>She's been taking her pumps with her to netball, school and youth club and been using them without me or her teachers, giving her a nudge.\n\n01:05.600 --> 01:07.680\n<v Speaker 2>She's really started to become independent with it.\n\n01:08.320 --> 01:09.360\n<v Speaker 1>Oh, that's excellent.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:15.720\n<v Speaker 1>I know she was getting a bit embarrassed about taking her pumps to school at one point, so this is great to hear.\n\n01:16.320 --> 01:22.600\n<v Speaker 2>Yeah, she was, but there is another girl in her form now who also has a pump, so I think she feels less conscious about it now.\n\n01:22.600 --> 01:24.160\n<v Speaker 1>And that's good.\n\n01:24.720 --> 01:27.080\n<v Speaker 1>You mentioned secret binge eating.\n\n01:27.760 --> 01:28.840\n<v Speaker 1>Tell me a little bit about that.\n\n01:28.840 --> 01:38.880\n<v Speaker 2>Yeah, we're not sure how long it's been going on for, but John and I were cleaning the house last week and in Jane's bin in her bedroom we noticed a number of chocolate wrappers and crisp packets.\n\n01:39.760 --> 01:42.400\n<v Speaker 1>Would you say it was a reasonable amount to expect?\n\n01:43.360 --> 01:50.480\n<v Speaker 2>We empty a bin daily and one day we saw 4 packets of crisps and three chocolate bars, so I would say that's quite unnecessary.\n\n01:51.280 --> 01:53.040\n<v Speaker 1>Yeah, that does sound a bit much.\n\n01:53.680 --> 01:54.960\n<v Speaker 1>Have you spoken to her about it?\n\n01:55.440 --> 02:00.480\n<v Speaker 2>We have mentioned to her about the sugar content and about taking what she doesn't need.\n\n02:00.480 --> 02:05.760\n<v Speaker 2>We have made a new rule in the house that she asks to have something from the tree cupboard now instead of just helping herself.\n\n02:06.280 --> 02:07.760\n<v Speaker 1>And that sounds like a good plan.\n\n02:08.480 --> 02:09.680\n<v Speaker 1>How did she take it?\n\n02:10.240 --> 02:11.200\n<v Speaker 1>Has she been following it?\n\n02:11.760 --> 02:15.480\n<v Speaker 2>To be fair to her, she has been asking either me or John before she goes in there.\n\n02:15.480 --> 02:18.880\n<v Speaker 2>It seems to be mainly in the evenings between her dinner and going to bed.\n\n02:19.560 --> 02:22.400\n<v Speaker 1>And do you think there's been a necessary trigger for this behaviour?\n\n02:22.960 --> 02:29.120\n<v Speaker 2>If I'm honest, I think it's since her grandmother passed away, she's been very upset about it all and I think she may be comfy eating.\n\n02:29.920 --> 02:32.160\n<v Speaker 1>Okay, that could be the cause.\n\n02:32.880 --> 02:34.720\n<v Speaker 1>I know you will, but will you keep an eye on it?\n\n02:35.400 --> 02:36.200\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, we will.\n\n02:36.200 --> 02:39.280\n<v Speaker 2>We have been dropping in conversations about healthy options too.\n\n02:39.560 --> 02:44.120\n<v Speaker 2>We started to buy alternatives like sweet breakfast bars instead of chocolate bars and things like that.\n\n02:44.760 --> 02:45.840\n<v Speaker 1>That's a great idea.\n\n02:46.800 --> 02:48.240\n<v Speaker 1>How are things going in school?\n\n02:48.800 --> 02:51.040\n<v Speaker 1>Has the recent loss had an effect on school?\n\n02:51.480 --> 02:54.200\n<v Speaker 2>We received a school report last week and it was lovely.\n\n02:54.200 --> 02:55.680\n<v Speaker 2>It was such a positive report.\n\n02:56.000 --> 03:01.600\n<v Speaker 2>The teachers said that she's really attentive and has a lovely group of friends that she engages well with throughout lessons.\n\n03:02.200 --> 03:04.000\n<v Speaker 1>Oh wow, I bet you're feeling proud.\n\n03:04.360 --> 03:05.440\n<v Speaker 1>That's lovely news.\n\n03:05.760 --> 03:06.640\n<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.\n\n03:06.640 --> 03:09.000\n<v Speaker 2>She's knuckled down this year and we are so pleased.\n\n03:09.920 --> 03:11.960\n<v Speaker 1>How has she been getting on with yourself and John?\n\n03:12.880 --> 03:14.160\n<v Speaker 2>I feel that she's getting on great.\n\n03:14.160 --> 03:18.760\n<v Speaker 2>She's been joining us for dinner and sitting with us after it too to watch TV and things like that.\n\n03:18.960 --> 03:21.200\n<v Speaker 2>She's really starting to warm into our family.\n\n03:21.800 --> 03:22.960\n<v Speaker 1>That's excellent news.\n\n03:23.280 --> 03:30.280\n<v Speaker 1>And I think what you're doing is great by giving her that opportunity to spend time in both, but not forcing her to either.\n\n03:30.800 --> 03:33.480\n<v Speaker 2>I'd prefer to encourage her and let her do it in her own time.\n\n03:33.680 --> 03:36.800\n<v Speaker 2>She has asked about adoption and when things like that tend to happen.\n\n03:37.040 --> 03:39.760\n<v Speaker 2>It did surprise me, but she came out with it.\n\n03:40.720 --> 03:41.440\n<v Speaker 1>Oh, okay.\n\n03:42.160 --> 03:46.760\n<v Speaker 1>Was she asking about it in a positive way, or do you think she was concerned about it?\n\n03:47.360 --> 03:51.120\n<v Speaker 2>She was definitely inquisitive and she started asking us whether we would adopt her.\n\n03:51.360 --> 03:52.800\n<v Speaker 2>We didn't really know what to say.\n\n03:52.800 --> 03:55.440\n<v Speaker 2>It put us in a bit of a difficult situation, if I'm honest.\n\n03:55.440 --> 03:56.800\n<v Speaker 2>We haven't really considered it.\n\n03:57.600 --> 04:00.560\n<v Speaker 1>It sounds like Jane is starting to settle more than you may think.\n\n04:01.120 --> 04:07.440\n<v Speaker 1>I think it's a positive thing that she started to ask these questions, but I appreciate it can be difficult to respond.\n\n04:07.920 --> 04:11.040\n<v Speaker 2>It caught me off guard and I just said, well, we'll see how things go.\n\n04:11.920 --> 04:23.360\n<v Speaker 1>Okay, what I can do is do some direct work with Jane, just about the process of adoption, what happens throughout the process, and hopefully answer any questions she may have.\n\n04:23.960 --> 04:25.600\n<v Speaker 1>That might take the pressure off you and John.\n\n04:25.800 --> 04:26.560\n<v Speaker 1>What do you think?\n\n04:26.880 --> 04:27.920\n<v Speaker 2>This would be great.\n\n04:28.240 --> 04:30.800\n<v Speaker 2>Just to give her a little bit more insight into what goes on.\n\n04:31.120 --> 04:34.640\n<v Speaker 2>I think she's just starting to get to the age where she's thinking more into the future.\n\n04:35.520 --> 04:36.360\n<v Speaker 1>Whilst I remember,\n\n04:37.120 --> 04:40.640\n<v Speaker 1>Jane has also asked for additional time during contact with Mum.\n\n04:41.280 --> 04:43.000\n<v Speaker 1>I know we spoke about it last time.\n\n04:43.000 --> 04:46.240\n<v Speaker 1>I was just wondering if you had an update on it.\n\n04:48.240 --> 04:55.320\n<v Speaker 1>So I've spoken with the contact centre to see what they can offer and they're able to provide an additional 2 hour slot per week.\n\n04:55.920 --> 04:59.960\n<v Speaker 1>I need to reach out to Mum to see if she's available to do it before we speak to Jane.\n\n05:01.040 --> 05:01.520\n<v Speaker 2>Perfect.\n\n05:01.520 --> 05:03.200\n<v Speaker 2>Jane would love it if this could happen.\n\n05:04.960 --> 05:06.880\n<v Speaker 1>How has Jane been outside of school?\n\n05:07.280 --> 05:10.560\n<v Speaker 1>I know you mentioned that she started to sit with you in the evenings, which is great.\n\n05:10.560 --> 05:12.960\n<v Speaker 1>What has she been like on the weekends?\n\n05:13.360 --> 05:15.040\n<v Speaker 2>Her behaviour is up and down.\n\n05:15.120 --> 05:19.280\n<v Speaker 2>I do think it's a result of her Nan passing, but last weekend was very challenging.\n\n05:19.840 --> 05:22.560\n<v Speaker 1>Okay, tell me a bit about what that looks like.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:27.360\n<v Speaker 2>On the weekend, we try and do something exciting, but lately she hasn't wanted to do anything.\n\n05:27.680 --> 05:31.600\n<v Speaker 2>It's got to the point last weekend where she completely shut down and didn't engage at all.\n\n05:31.920 --> 05:35.040\n<v Speaker 2>She went to her bedroom and sat scrolling on her phone for hours.\n\n05:35.320 --> 05:40.080\n<v Speaker 2>We were checking in on her, but she would just shrug her shoulders or shake her head when we were trying to speak with her.\n\n05:40.880 --> 05:42.240\n<v Speaker 1>And do you think there's any triggers?\n\n05:42.720 --> 05:44.080\n<v Speaker 2>Nothing that sprung to mind.\n\n05:44.080 --> 05:44.880\n<v Speaker 2>I just think she had...\n\n05:46.560 --> 05:49.600\n<v Speaker 2>a bit more time to think and she got herself upset about her nan.\n\n05:50.520 --> 05:52.240\n<v Speaker 1>And that's completely natural, isn't it?\n\n05:52.880 --> 05:55.600\n<v Speaker 1>Has she ever been aggressive towards you or anything?\n\n05:55.680 --> 05:56.960\n<v Speaker 2>No, nothing like that.\n\n05:57.280 --> 05:59.360\n<v Speaker 2>She doesn't even shout or raise a voice at her.\n\n05:59.440 --> 06:02.320\n<v Speaker 2>She just becomes very withdrawn and goes upstairs to her room.\n\n06:04.160 --> 06:06.800\n<v Speaker 2>It's strange, but I guess it's just something she's going through.\n\n06:07.280 --> 06:13.280\n<v Speaker 2>On another note, though, she has been bringing up her friends here after school, and they are a really nice group of girls.\n\n06:13.280 --> 06:17.680\n<v Speaker 2>They spend most of the time dancing and copying TikToks, but she's really happy with them.\n\n06:18.560 --> 06:20.640\n<v Speaker 1>It's great that she has a nice friendship group.\n\n06:20.840 --> 06:22.480\n<v Speaker 1>That's one less thing to worry about.\n\n06:22.960 --> 06:23.920\n<v Speaker 2>It really is.\n\n06:24.160 --> 06:26.800\n<v Speaker 2>In the summer, I know she's going to stay with mum for a few days.\n\n06:27.040 --> 06:31.200\n<v Speaker 2>Both John and I are a little worried about her not wanting to return to us after the stay.\n\n06:31.760 --> 06:36.240\n<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned that she'll want to stay with him and at the moment we know that that's not the best option.\n\n06:37.480 --> 06:39.520\n<v Speaker 1>That is a natural concern to have, Susan.\n\n06:40.240 --> 06:46.040\n<v Speaker 1>I think to try and mitigate it, we need to ensure the message to Jane is clear about the purpose of the visit.\n\n06:46.640 --> 06:51.960\n<v Speaker 1>We don't want her to feel like that we don't want her to go, but we just need to manage her expectations.\n\n06:52.320 --> 06:54.160\n<v Speaker 1>We can revisit it closer to the time.\n\n06:54.720 --> 06:57.600\n<v Speaker 2>Yeah, I don't want to upset her before the end of her exams.\n\n06:58.080 --> 06:58.880\n<v Speaker 1>Of course.\n\n06:59.360 --> 07:00.480\n<v Speaker 1>How are her exams going?\n\n07:00.880 --> 07:01.920\n<v Speaker 2>Good so far.\n\n07:01.920 --> 07:03.920\n<v Speaker 2>She's been revising about three days a week.\n\n07:04.400 --> 07:09.200\n<v Speaker 2>At the start she needed some encouragement, but recently she's been doing it off her own back.\n\n07:09.440 --> 07:11.760\n<v Speaker 2>I think she started to realise the importance of it.\n\n07:12.240 --> 07:16.080\n<v Speaker 2>She came out of her exam last week and said it was easier than she thought.\n\n07:16.560 --> 07:23.040\n<v Speaker 2>We said to her that it was difficult, that it was because she put the work in with revising, so she would find it easier.\n\n07:23.440 --> 07:24.880\n<v Speaker 2>Things are starting to click.\n\n07:25.040 --> 07:29.200\n<v Speaker 2>The last four weeks have been tough for her, but she has always found time to revise.\n\n07:29.200 --> 07:31.040\n<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bit of an escape for her too.\n\n07:31.920 --> 07:32.720\n<v Speaker 1>That is very mature.\n\n07:32.920 --> 07:34.560\n<v Speaker 1>I'm glad it's going well for her.\n\n07:35.200 --> 07:37.680\n<v Speaker 1>Did school honour the extra exam time too?\n\n07:38.640 --> 07:39.200\n<v Speaker 2>They did.\n\n07:39.200 --> 07:42.880\n<v Speaker 2>She gets an additional 20% on top of full exam time.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.640\n<v Speaker 2>I think she's found it very useful too.\n\n07:44.640 --> 07:45.520\n<v Speaker 1>Oh, good.\n\n07:45.520 --> 07:46.400\n<v Speaker 1>That's great for her.\n\n07:47.120 --> 07:49.280\n<v Speaker 1>I'm glad school have been supportive with this.\n\n07:49.760 --> 07:50.680\n<v Speaker 2>We're so pleased.\n\n07:50.680 --> 07:52.800\n<v Speaker 2>We want to take her away after the exams are over.\n\n07:53.040 --> 07:55.680\n<v Speaker 2>Obviously, we just need to make sure that we have her passport in time.\n\n07:56.240 --> 07:59.040\n<v Speaker 1>I will trace the application when I'm back in the office.\n\n07:59.360 --> 08:03.960\n<v Speaker 1>I have put one in and I've had confirmation that they've received it, so it won't be long.\n\n08:04.760 --> 08:07.320\n<v Speaker 1>I'll give them a nudge to see if they can give us a time frame though.\n\n08:07.680 --> 08:09.200\n<v Speaker 2>That would be really helpful.\n\n08:09.200 --> 08:09.520\n<v Speaker 2>Thank you.\n\n08:10.800 --> 08:13.520\n<v Speaker 1>Have yourself or John completed any training recently?\n\n08:13.760 --> 08:20.720\n<v Speaker 2>Not recently, but we have inquired about a course that's running in the community in October around first aid.\n\n08:21.920 --> 08:25.280\n<v Speaker 1>We've received all of the recordings from you both too, so that's been great.\n\n08:26.080 --> 08:31.120\n<v Speaker 1>I think the training in October would be really good for you both, so make sure you join that too.```",
