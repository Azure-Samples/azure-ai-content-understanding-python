Jenny.\n\n00:06.840 --> 00:08.080\n<v Speaker 2>I'm doing well, thank you.\n\n00:08.520 --> 00:09.400\n<v Speaker 1>That's great to hear.\n\n00:10.200 --> 00:12.000\n<v Speaker 1>Thank you for agreeing to meet with me today.\n\n00:12.480 --> 00:13.800\n<v Speaker 2>That's okay, no problem.\n\n00:14.560 --> 00:21.360\n<v Speaker 1>So today, I'd just like to have a chat, touch on some things that you've submitted in your application.\n\n00:21.920 --> 00:22.880\n<v Speaker 1>Does that sound okay?\n\n00:23.280 --> 00:24.320\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, sure.\n\n00:24.480 --> 00:25.120\n<v Speaker 2>Sounds good.\n\n00:26.080 --> 00:26.400\n<v Speaker 1>Great.\n\n00:26.800 --> 00:30.360\n<v Speaker 1>So I see from your application you have a diverse background.\n\n00:30.960 --> 00:33.200\n<v Speaker 1>Could we start with your time in the military?\n\n00:33.840 --> 00:34.560\n<v Speaker 2>Certainly.\n\n00:37.440 --> 00:40.000\n<v Speaker 2>I joined the military right after finishing my O-levels.\n\n00:40.320 --> 00:41.920\n<v Speaker 2>I served for about 5 years.\n\n00:43.200 --> 00:49.000\n<v Speaker 2>It was a challenging yet rewarding experience and I gained a lot of skills and discipline during my time there.\n\n00:49.800 --> 00:51.120\n<v Speaker 1>That sounds impressive.\n\n00:51.760 --> 00:53.680\n<v Speaker 1>What prompted you to leave the military?\n\n00:54.160 --> 00:55.360\n<v Speaker 2>After 5 years,\n\n00:55.760 --> 00:57.440\n<v Speaker 2>I felt it was time for a change.\n\n00:57.760 --> 01:02.520\n<v Speaker 2>I wanted to explore different career opportunities and decided to move into the private sector.\n\n01:03.400 --> 01:05.120\n<v Speaker 2>That's when I joined a scaffold company.\n\n01:05.360 --> 01:09.280\n<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do something active and didn't really want to be stuck in an office style job.\n\n01:10.240 --> 01:16.080\n<v Speaker 1>Interesting transition, but I can see why you wanted to be up and about rather than sat at a desk.\n\n01:16.960 --> 01:19.680\n<v Speaker 1>Can you tell me more about your role at the scaffolding company?\n\n01:20.320 --> 01:20.800\n<v Speaker 2>Sure.\n\n01:21.400 --> 01:23.280\n<v Speaker 2>I worked there for about 3 years.\n\n01:23.760 --> 01:32.800\n<v Speaker 2>My primary responsibilities included assembling and dismantling scaffolding structures, ensuring safety protocols were followed and managing a small team.\n\n01:32.960 --> 01:35.600\n<v Speaker 2>It was physically demanding work, but I enjoyed it.\n\n01:36.280 --> 01:38.320\n<v Speaker 1>Yeah, sounds like a lot of responsibility.\n\n01:39.160 --> 01:41.120\n<v Speaker 1>What made you leave the scaffold company?\n\n01:42.040 --> 01:46.320\n<v Speaker 2>I was looking for something less physically demanding and with more regular hours.\n\n01:46.760 --> 01:52.080\n<v Speaker 2>That's when I found a position as a checkout assistant in a well-known supermarket where I currently work.\n\n01:53.000 --> 01:56.160\n<v Speaker 1>And how has your experience been working as a checkout assistant?\n\n01:56.720 --> 02:01.040\n<v Speaker 2>It's been quite different from my previous jobs, but it's been a good experience.\n\n02:01.520 --> 02:06.480\n<v Speaker 2>I've developed strong customer service skills and enjoy interacting with people on a daily basis.\n\n02:06.960 --> 02:11.440\n<v Speaker 2>It doesn't physically challenge me, but it's nice to interact with people on a daily basis.\n\n02:11.760 --> 02:12.720\n<v Speaker 1>Yeah, that's great.\n\n02:12.960 --> 02:17.600\n<v Speaker 1>It gives me a good understanding of your background and the skills you bring to the table.\n\n02:18.960 --> 02:22.400\n<v Speaker 1>You mentioned that you joined the military after completing your O-Levels.\n\n02:22.960 --> 02:25.120\n<v Speaker 1>Is this your highest qualification to date?\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:26.880\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, it is.\n\n02:27.400 --> 02:33.360\n<v Speaker 2>By the time I finished my O-levels, I just wanted to start earning money, so I didn't go to college or anything like that.\n\n02:34.200 --> 02:35.520\n<v Speaker 1>Thank you for sharing that, Joe.\n\n02:35.600 --> 02:38.000\n<v Speaker 1>Now, let's talk a little bit about your home.\n\n02:38.600 --> 02:41.440\n<v Speaker 1>When I pulled up, I noticed the beautiful double drive.\n\n02:42.560 --> 02:44.160\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, I like my cars.\n\n02:44.760 --> 02:48.000\n<v Speaker 2>I used to have one for driving to work and one for the weekend.\n\n02:48.440 --> 02:49.600\n<v Speaker 2>But my work car,\n\n02:49.840 --> 02:54.120\n<v Speaker 2>Used to get so dirty from being a scaffolder, I've just got the one car now.\n\n02:54.160 --> 02:54.240\n<v Speaker 2>Oh.\n\n02:55.280 --> 02:56.680\n<v Speaker 1>How lovely to be able to do that.\n\n02:56.680 --> 02:57.680\n<v Speaker 1>What a luxury.\n\n02:58.000 --> 02:59.600\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, expensive though.\n\n03:04.160 --> 03:05.200\n<v Speaker 2>So this is my living room.\n\n03:05.600 --> 03:10.560\n<v Speaker 2>I spend the evenings in here to chill out and watch some TV or read.\n\n03:11.080 --> 03:13.200\n<v Speaker 2>My office space is just across the hallway.\n\n03:13.680 --> 03:16.800\n<v Speaker 2>I tend to play on the Xbox in there if I've got some downtime.\n\n03:17.200 --> 03:19.520\n<v Speaker 2>I keep my laptop on my monitor in there too.\n\n03:19.960 --> 03:25.240\n<v Speaker 2>I don't use it much, usually for looking for holidays or booking events and concerts, things like that.\n\n03:26.080 --> 03:29.840\n<v Speaker 1>It's a lovely separate space to your living area and quite a big space too.\n\n03:30.560 --> 03:31.280\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, it is.\n\n03:31.760 --> 03:35.360\n<v Speaker 2>It could be changed into a playroom if I was to foster a younger child.\n\n03:35.720 --> 03:36.880\n<v Speaker 1>That sounds ideal.\n\n03:37.680 --> 03:40.720\n<v Speaker 2>The kitchen area is where I spend the majority of my time.\n\n03:40.960 --> 03:44.720\n<v Speaker 2>I enjoy cooking and I have my family around most Sundays for lunch.\n\n03:45.200 --> 03:48.400\n<v Speaker 2>My sister brings her daughter, who is 6, and husband.\n\n03:48.600 --> 03:50.000\n<v Speaker 2>and my parents come over too.\n\n03:50.640 --> 03:52.480\n<v Speaker 1>Oh, so full house on a Sunday then?\n\n03:53.120 --> 03:58.800\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, it is something we've always done and it's our way of staying in touch, I suppose.\n\n03:59.360 --> 04:02.600\n<v Speaker 2>They all live within 10 minutes of here too, which is nice.\n\n04:02.600 --> 04:06.320\n<v Speaker 1>And what do they think about you potentially becoming a carer?\n\n04:07.440 --> 04:09.440\n<v Speaker 2>They are so excited about it.\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:15.360\n<v Speaker 2>I've never been married or had a long-term partner, just because I think work has always taken a priority.\n\n04:15.600 --> 04:18.960\n<v Speaker 2>But now I'm more settled with work, I'd really like to support the child.\n\n04:19.440 --> 04:20.440\n<v Speaker 1>And that's great to hear.\n\n04:20.440 --> 04:24.040\n<v Speaker 1>And it's lovely that they're looking forward to the possibility of that.\n\n04:25.520 --> 04:27.600\n<v Speaker 2>Upstairs, I've got 3 bedrooms.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:30.320\n<v Speaker 2>I only use the one for myself.\n\n04:30.320 --> 04:34.400\n<v Speaker 2>The other two tend to just be for additional storage, but there's not much in them.\n\n04:35.280 --> 04:37.760\n<v Speaker 1>Are there any rooms suitable for children?\n\n04:39.120 --> 04:43.880\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, once I've taken out anything of mine, they are good size rooms for a child.\n\n04:44.320 --> 04:48.240\n<v Speaker 2>The one room is most appropriate as they're built-in wardrobes and an en suite.\n\n04:48.560 --> 04:51.160\n<v Speaker 2>They'd have their own space and own bathroom, which would be good.\n\n04:51.160 --> 04:54.960\n<v Speaker 1>And there's some lovely room views in these bedrooms too.\n\n04:56.000 --> 04:59.680\n<v Speaker 2>Yeah, the house backs onto the golf course, so it's very private and quiet.\n\n05:00.440 --> 05:02.280\n<v Speaker 1>And your outdoor space looks great too.\n\n05:03.040 --> 05:05.360\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, I like to keep the garden tidy.\n\n05:05.520 --> 05:07.840\n<v Speaker 2>That's part of the reason why I don't have any pets.\n\n05:08.240 --> 05:09.920\n<v Speaker 2>I had the patio area done last.\n\n05:10.160 --> 05:13.240\n<v Speaker 2>last year, but I kept a bit of grass just to keep a bit of colour.\n\n05:13.240 --> 05:13.280\n<v Speaker 2>I.\n\n05:13.960 --> 05:14.960\n<v Speaker 1>Can see you have a hot tub.\n\n05:15.920 --> 05:18.320\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, I need to put it away to be honest.\n\n05:18.440 --> 05:20.320\n<v Speaker 2>I only use it in the summer.\n\n05:20.640 --> 05:27.440\n<v Speaker 2>My friends from running club come around sometimes for a BBQ and I usually get the hot tub going too if people want to use it.\n\n05:28.320 --> 05:30.400\n<v Speaker 1>Ah, so it's a temporary one, I see.\n\n05:31.040 --> 05:34.560\n<v Speaker 1>Just wanted to flag and ensure that you were aware of the safety requirements.\n\n05:35.200 --> 05:38.640\n<v Speaker 1>There are some guidelines around age restrictions of using hot tubs too.\n\n05:39.680 --> 05:40.960\n<v Speaker 2>Yes, that's no problem.\n\n05:41.120 --> 05:44.720\n<v Speaker 2>We don't allow my niece in there as much as she is desperate to go in.\n\n05:45.200 --> 05:45.840\n<v Speaker 1>That's okay.\n\n05:46.080 --> 05:47.600\n<v Speaker 1>As long as you're aware, that's great.\n\n05:48.400 --> 05:52.480\n<v Speaker 2>My niece has a learning difficulty too, so she has a younger mental age.\n\n05:52.800 --> 05:55.280\n<v Speaker 2>So we've got to be mindful of the type of activities we do.\n\n05:56.240 --> 05:58.360\n<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned a running club.\n\n05:58.920 --> 06:00.120\n<v Speaker 1>Tell me a little bit about that.\n\n06:01.120 --> 06:03.520\n<v Speaker 2>Yeah, I run for Torvine Harriers.\n\n06:03.960 --> 06:05.120\n<v Speaker 2>I've been there four years now.\n\n06:05.200 --> 06:05.840\n<v Speaker 2>I love it.\n\n06:05.920 --> 06:08.560\n<v Speaker 2>It just keeps me motivated and stay healthy.\n\n06:09.280 --> 06:11.040\n<v Speaker 1>And what are the commitments for the club?\n\n06:11.440 --> 06:13.120\n<v Speaker 1>Do you meet regularly to compete?\n\n06:14.080 --> 06:15.480\n<v Speaker 2>It's not a competitive club.\n\n06:15.920 --> 06:17.520\n<v Speaker 2>It's more of a social running club.\n\n06:18.000 --> 06:21.040\n<v Speaker 2>We meet once a week on a Wednesday to do a 5k run.\n\n06:21.440 --> 06:25.400\n<v Speaker 2>It's great in the summer because we sometimes finish in a local pub and have some dinner.\n\n06:25.840 --> 06:27.800\n<v Speaker 2>It's really got that social club feeling.\n\n06:27.800 --> 06:27.840\n<v Speaker 2>Oh.\n\n06:28.480 --> 06:29.360\n<v Speaker 1>That is nice.\n\n06:29.840 --> 06:32.040\n<v Speaker 1>So you don't really get that pressured feeling.\n\n06:32.800 --> 06:33.680\n<v Speaker 2>Not at all.\n\n06:33.840 --> 06:35.840\n<v Speaker 2>If anything, it spears me on to do more.\n\n06:36.320 --> 06:40.080\n<v Speaker 2>I try and get in another three runs throughout the week on my lunch break.\n\n06:40.400 --> 06:47.040\n<v Speaker 2>Obviously, if I had the pleasure of fostering, I'd take this into consideration and I'd work around their needs.\n\n06:47.520 --> 06:49.400\n<v Speaker 2>I'd do it when they're in school at ETC.\n\n06:49.400 --> 06:53.480\n<v Speaker 1>How do you like to spend your weekends?\n\n06:54.640 --> 06:55.680\n<v Speaker 2>I like to keep active.\n\n06:55.840 --> 06:59.680\n<v Speaker 2>So I tend to get outdoors and go on some natural nature walks.\n\n07:00.000 --> 07:04.560\n<v Speaker 2>I tend to stay fairly local, but when the weather is nice, me and a few people from the running club,\n\n07:04.960 --> 07:09.600\n<v Speaker 2>like to go to Penyfan and up the Brecon Beacons area, but you've got to have the weather.\n\n07:10.160 --> 07:12.080\n<v Speaker 1>Yeah, that sounds great and peaceful.\n\n07:12.720 --> 07:14.560\n<v Speaker 1>What would you do if you had a child with you?\n\n07:15.520 --> 07:17.440\n<v Speaker 2>I'd love for them to come with me.\n\n07:17.760 --> 07:19.840\n<v Speaker 2>I think being outdoors is so beneficial.\n\n07:20.560 --> 07:21.280\n<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.\n\n07:21.920 --> 07:28.720\n<v Speaker 1>So just to make you aware, in regards to the process, you will need to be having a DPS check throughout the assessment process.\n\n07:29.440 --> 07:33.760\n<v Speaker 1>We will need three names of different people so we can obtain references to.\n\n07:34.560 --> 07:38.240\n<v Speaker 1>As part of the assessment, you will also be required to undergo a medical.\n\n07:39.200 --> 07:40.640\n<v Speaker 2>Sure, no problem.\n\n07:40.800 --> 07:42.720\n<v Speaker 2>I haven't got any health issues or anything.\n\n07:43.280 --> 07:44.000\n<v Speaker 1>Okay, great.\n\n07:44.720 --> 07:50.000\n<v Speaker 1>There are also some expectations to attend 15 hours of training a month once you have been approved.\n\n07:50.800 --> 07:55.320\n<v Speaker 1>One piece of training that you must attend prior to being approved is skills to foster.\n\n07:56.320 --> 08:01.880\n<v Speaker 1>Once you have attended the training, you will need to attend the approval panel and providing you are approved,\n\n08:02.320 --> 08:06.160\n<v Speaker 1>you will need to attend carer reviews that will take place annually.\n\n08:07.200 --> 08:10.400\n<v Speaker 2>I'm more than happy to attend the training panel and reviews.\n\n08:10.800 --> 08:13.360\n<v Speaker 2>Will I have regular support from the local authority at all?\n\n08:13.920 --> 08:17.120\n<v Speaker 1>Yes, you'll be assigned a supervising social worker.\n\n08:17.760 --> 08:21.040\n<v Speaker 1>They will provide ongoing support and also monthly supervisions.\n\n08:21.880 --> 08:22.480\n<v Speaker 2>That's good.\n\n08:22.600 --> 08:23.760\n<v Speaker 2>What about holidays?\n\n08:23.760 --> 08:25.040\n<v Speaker 2>Can I take them on holiday?\n\n08:25.360 --> 08:29.120\n<v Speaker 1>You can, you just need to complete a form with your supervising social worker.\n\n08:29.680 --> 08:32.960\n<v Speaker 1>They can revise on the logistics based on the holiday.\n\n08:33.520 --> 08:37.440\n<v Speaker 1>There are different rules dependent on whether the holiday is in this country or abroad.\n\n08:38.640 --> 08:41.320\n<v Speaker 1>There are also payments that you'll be receiving every fortnight.\n\n08:42.160 --> 08:45.200\n<v Speaker 1>The details will be confirmed with you during the approval stage.\n\n08:45.760 --> 08:50.800\n<v Speaker 1>The payments are for the child and you will have a full breakdown of where the funds should be spent.\n\n08:52.240 --> 08:55.200\n<v Speaker 2>This sounds good and I'm glad there's support available.\n\n08:55.840 --> 08:58.720\n<v Speaker 1>So overall, how are you feeling about it?\n\n09:00.120 --> 09:02.760\n<v Speaker 2>I'm really looking forward to hopefully being able to foster.\n\n09:03.160 --> 09:06.240\n<v Speaker 2>I feel like I could really give a good like to someone.\n\n09:08.720 --> 09:13.760\n<v Speaker 2>I'd love to take them on holidays, explore the outdoors and provide safety and stability.\n\n09:14.240 --> 09:20.400\n<v Speaker 2>I often see families out walking when I do trails and I always wish that I could share that experience too.\n\n09:21.280 --> 09:25.120\n<v Speaker 2>I'd love to take a child out to the local activity centre\n\n09:25.360 --> 09:27.680\n<v Speaker 2>paddle boarding, canoeing, rock climbing.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:30.640\n<v Speaker 2>I just think that's what it's all about, enjoying life.\n\n09:31.040 --> 09:36.120\n<v Speaker 2>I try and tag along with my sister when she takes her daughter to these places because I absolutely love it.\n\n09:36.120 --> 09:39.160\n<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you have a lot to offer, Jo.\n\n09:40.320 --> 09:46.960\n<v Speaker 2>Yeah, and as my niece has some learning difficulties, I feel that I've already got some good experience with this.\n\n09:47.120 --> 09:49.360\n<v Speaker 2>It's taught me to be adaptable and patient.\n\n09:49.680 --> 09:54.320\n<v Speaker 2>Since my sister has had her child, I've really wanted to start this journey myself.\n\n09:55.160 --> 09:56.280\n<v Speaker 1>And that's wonderful to hear.\n\n09:56.280 --> 10:00.280\n<v Speaker 1>I'll pop back to the office and get things rolling my end.\n\n10:00.720 --> 10:05.720\n<v Speaker 1>Can I just ask that you send through the names of the referees, please, and I'll request those ASAP.\n\n10:08.480 --> 10:12.640\n<v Speaker 1>There is a panel in two weeks' time, so hopefully we can get everybody together ready for that one.```",
